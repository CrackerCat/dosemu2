ANNOUNCEMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOSEMU team is proud to announce DOSEMU 1.4.0,
the PC Emulator for x86 based Linux.

WHAT IS DOSEMU?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DOSEMU is a PC Emulator application that allows Linux to run a DOS
operating system in a virtual x86 machine. This allows you to run
many DOS applications. These are the capabilities of DOSEMU that are
worth noting:

  - color text and full keyboard emulation (via hotkeys) even on a terminal
  - built-in X Window System support (includes IBM character set font)
    including fullscreen X (via Ctrl-Alt-F)
  - graphics capability at the console (for most compatible video cards)
    (requires suid-root or sudo)
  - graphics emulation in X for many color modes
    (X-server may be in true color mode)
  - DPMI support
  - runs most 16-bit and 32-bit DPMI-compliant video games (including those
    based on DOS/4GW) at the Linux console and on X
  - integrated (command line) instruction level debugger, various break
    points, single stepping etc.
  - integrated EMS and XMS drivers
  - integrated packet driver
  - integrated mouse driver
  - integrated joystick driver
  - CDROM support
  - ASPI driver support (CD writers, scanners, tapes etc.)
    (requires access rights to /dev/sgX)
  - support for redirected drives (any Linux directory can be 'mounted'
    as DOS drive via the lredir command)
  - can even directly boot from a Linux directory containing all DOS files
  - sound support (including sound DMA and Midi)
  - NetWare and other network connectivity via built-in IPX and pktdrvr
    support
  - the dosemu-freedos binary package starts a DOS-"C:\>"-Drive
    'out-of-the-box' in a normal user's $HOME directory and runs without 
    any further configuration (no root rights needed)

WHAT IS NEW against version 1.2.2?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Many bugs have been fixed.
- Added a native 64-bit port for x86-64, which, by default, uses CPU emulation
  for V86 mode, and runs DPMI code natively.
- For a first time boot with FreeDOS, DOSEMU now boots without any user
  interaction, and presents a welcome screen. 
- "dosemu" starts xdosemu by default in X. Use "dosemu -t" to force terminal
  mode.
- Everyone, including root, needs to use "dosemu -s" to be able to use direct
  hardware access. The -s switch automatically uses direct VGA graphics and
  raw keyboard mode on the Linux console.
- You can reboot the DOSEMU virtual machine using Ctrl-Alt-Del
- The utility unix.com can now execute Linux commands within DOSEMU
  interactively.
- Run-time plugins are used to allow binary distribution without depending
  on all libraries.
- The -dumb switch quietens DOSEMU until the command is executed if a command
  is given. So "dosemu -dumb dir" gives a directory listing and nothing else.
- VGA Emulator: bitmap fonts are much quicker.
- Fixed new errors and warnings with GCC 4.x.
- The dosemu script is compatible with the minimal shell dash.
- An automatic backtrace using GDB (output in ~/.dosemu/boot.log)
  is attempted when DOSEMU crashes.
- DOSEMU's stack is no longer marked executable which may improve security.
- Clarified the copyrights and replaced some code with unclear origins.
  The disclaimer acceptance has been weakened.
- CPU emulation (SIMX86)
  - The SIMX86 simulator is now a runtime option, activated via
    $_cpuemu="vm86sim", or $_cpuemu="fullsim". Without the "sim"
    JIT compilation (dynamic translation) is used.
  - SIMX86 is automatically invoked if the vm86 is not supported by the
    Linux kernel. This includes x86-64 systems, kernel configurations
    for embedded use, and some virtualization systems.
- DPMI
  - Implemented DPMI uncommitted memory support.
  - Support for the HX DOS Extender was added. It is now possible to run
    some win32 console applications under dosemu, using that extender.
  - The Blinker extender is now fully supported (all known versions).
  - The PM API translator now uses the EMS page frame to save 64K
    of conventional memory.
  - Many DPMI and PM API translator fixes to support all commercial
    Borland tools and other protected-mode programs, especially when
    using Linux kernel 2.6.12 or newer.
  - Most of the DPMI 1.0 API and functionality were added.
  - Fixed IF flag virtualization for DPMI. This causes many DPMI applications
    to work reliably without random crashes (such as Transport Tycoon,
    Screamer, Vchess).
  - Implemented LDT virtualization / direct LDT access for DPMI clients.
  - Windows 3.1 now works natively, without any need for WINOS2 patches.
  - Many other improvements to make Windows 3 in DOSEMU more stable and usable.
  - Implemented debug breakpoints for DPMI.
  - Customized SVGA drivers of Windows 3.11 can now be used instead
    of the Trident drivers (refer to Section 9.2 of README.txt).
- Memory management
  - Improved the internal XMS driver.
  - It is now possible to use an external XMS driver, such as himem.sys.
  - Freed up 4K of UMB space.
- File systems
  - The default C: drive has changed from ~/dosemu/freedos to ~/.dosemu/drive_c
    (similar to Wine). Drive Z: is now a read-only drive with all the DOSEMU
    and FreeDOS support files.
  - Added support for the Long File Name (int21/ah=71) interface on redirected
    drives.
  - The redirected drive file system code is much faster than before.
  - You can now directly see and manipulate DOS file attributes on Lredir'ed
    Linux-mounted (V)FAT partitions, when using recent 2.6 kernels.
  - Lredir can now automatically find a new drive.
- CDROM and floppies
  - Added a $_cdrom option for runtime configuration of the CD-ROM device.
  - Added an internal *CDEX style CD-ROM driver, activated using LREDIR, for
    use with CD-ROMs that are mounted in Linux. The default autoexec.bat
    uses this to set drive E: to a CD-ROM.
  - It is now possible to point $_vbootfloppy, $_floppy_a etc. to directories
    and boot from them.
  - The floppy is much faster with 2.6 kernels.
  - Added support for 2.88M floppies
- Sound, mice, keyboards, printers, serial ports, I/O, and networking
  - A new sound system is available. It is for now an optional run-time option,
    $_sound=(2).
  - Added some support for sound recording.
  - Added the "INT 15h" PS/2 mouse interface.
  - Much improved keyboard layout auto-detection
  - The printer code now uses line buffering so that you do not have to
    wait $_printer_timeout seconds before printing starts.
  - Use $_lpt1, $_lpt2, and $_lpt3 for printer configuration.
  - TTY locking can be disabled by $_ttylocks=""
  - The reliability and performance of the serial ports emulation are much
    improved.
  - I/O ports are "fast" by default.
  - IPX and Packet Driver code was seriously reworked.
- Timers
  - Added $_time_mode="linux" option to force the DOS clock to sync with
    the Linux time.
  - Improved real time clock support with a periodic IRQ generator.
- Terminals
  - UTF-8 terminals are supported if you use SLang 2 or a UTF-8
    patched SLang 1 library. The supplied SLang library subset is no
    longer necessary and no longer provided.
  - $_term_char_set no longer exists;
    $_external_char_set now defaults to the current locale.
  - Even on non UTF-8 terminals many line drawing characters can now
    be used, and on the Linux console almost the full CP437 character set.
  - Many ctrl, alt, shift combinations with function keys, arrow keys, etc,
    can now be used in xterm and friends.
  - VGA hardware is emulated in terminal mode as well as in X mode.
- Linux console
  - VESA driver added which should be compatible with most BIOSes. This
    is the default.
  - Linear frame buffers now work.
  - Improved behaviour in conjunction with frame buffer consoles.
  - Improved PCI emulation on the console, with $_pci=(auto).
- X Window System
  - Added extra X fonts.
  - The X aspect ratio is no longer set to 4:3 by default, but an integer
    multiple of the real resolution.
  - A graphical mouse cursor now works under X with mouse grab enabled.
  - Added keyboard grab, hard-coded to Ctrl-Alt-k for now.
  - Add $_X_title_show_appname.
  - Implemented support for Unicode fonts for $_X_font, so you can for
    instance use the univga font or
    $_X_font="-Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-SemiCondensed--13-120-75-75-C-60-ISO10646-1"
  - 16 bpp graphics programs now run in X with 24/32 bpp.
- SDL support
  New: makes it possible to run DOSEMU on all supported SDL back-ends.
  It is almost as capable as the X plug-in, and provides a safer way
  to get console graphics, using fbdev.
- Removed mapself support, the old keyboard code, coopthreads, and comcom.
