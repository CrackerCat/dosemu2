     * Millenium
          + Millenium game fails to detect Sound Blaster, unless the SB
            IRQ is 5
            Solution: set $_sb_irq=(5). Fortunately this is a default
            setting, so in most cases you won't care.

     * Screamer
          + Screamer crashes at startup
            Solution: you need do update dos4gw that comes with the game,
            to version 1.97. Or you can use dos32a like this:

    dos32a.exe starth.exe
