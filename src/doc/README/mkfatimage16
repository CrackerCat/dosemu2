To put it brief, mkfatimage16 creates an hdimage file for dosemu that's
pre-loaded with the files specified on the command line. Its purpose is to
remove the need to include an hdimage.dist file in the dosemu distribution
(and it saves about 100K in the .tar.gz size on the way).

<para>
mkfatimage16 takes an additional switch [-t number_of_tracks] and automatically
switches to the 16-bit FAT format if the specified size is &gt; 16MB.
