2008-03-27  Bart

	* [r1853] ChangeLog, NEWS:
	  DOSEMU 1.4.0.1

	* [r1852] configure, configure.ac, src/commands/Makefile,
	  src/plugin/commands/Makefile:
	  Fix 64-bit compilation on 32-bit systems and vice versa.

	* [r1851] src/base/bios/hlt.c, src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c,
	  src/plugin/kbd_unicode/keyb_raw.c:
	  Fix more gcc warnings for 64-bit compilation.

	* [r1850] src/base/bios/int10.c, src/plugin/term/terminal.c:
	  Cleaner fix for terminal memory map race.

2008-03-26  Bart

	* [r1849] VERSION:
	  DOSEMU 1.4.0.1

	* [r1848] Makefile:
	  Remove configure.lineno on distclean.

	* [r1847] src/base/init/lexer.l.in:
	  Avoid gcc-4.3 warning about unused input function in lexer.

	* [r1846] src/base/bios/int10.c, src/plugin/term/terminal.c:
	  Add a call to video->update_screen to int10/ah=0 modesets to make
	  sure the terminal is initialized. Fixes a race (though it should be
	  done more cleanly).

2008-03-25  Bart

	* [r1845] src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/midid/timid.c,
	  src/plugin/midimisc/mid_o_tmdty.c:
	  In timidity plugin and midid code: use socketpair as a bidirectional
	  pipe: older versions (current as of 2008 :( ) of timidity write to
	  stdin and we can catch that to avoid waiting 3 seconds at select at
	  DOSEMU startup.

2008-03-21  Bart

	* [r1844] src/dosext/mfs/lfn.c:
	  Add missing "return" for LFN findnext error. Fixes #1801411: Running
	  File Wizard crashes DOSEMU 1.4.0.0.

	* [r1843] src/plugin/term/keyb_slang.c, src/plugin/term/terminal.c:
	  Added some diagnostics to check for UTF-8 terminal mismatches;
	  "fixes" bug #1729556.

2008-03-18  Bart

	* [r1842] src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.c:
	  Try to fix #1910153 again: we need to round to PAGE_SIZE for the loop
	  termination test because of backwards jumps and NOJUMPS.

	* [r1841] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c:
	  SF-Patch #1683073: handle 16bit address overflow in string
	  instructions. Fixes overflow in the simulator of cpu-emu. Adjusted
	  from Michael Karcher's patch.

2008-03-17  Bart

	* [r1840] src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.c:
	  Bail out of node-to-invalidate check loop for the sorted list once
	  the base (instead of the PC-beginning of the block) is past the
	  affected address. Really fixes #1910153: SkyRoads failure: JIT fails
	  some self-modifying code (Michael Karcher).

2008-03-16  Bart

	* [r1839] src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.h:
	  Fix #1910153 SkyRoads failure: JIT fails some self-modifying code.
	  The dnpc field needs to be signed because it can be negative and is
	  compared to negative "int"s in BreakNode.

2008-03-11  Bart

	* [r1838] src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c:
	  Patch #1910535, Michael Karcher: fix for "e_vgaemu_fault corrupts
	  eip/rip"

	* [r1837] src/env/video/vgaemu.c:
	  In Super-VGA modes, do *not* wrap memory at 256k. SF patch #1910415,
	  Michael Karcher; fixes bug #1806787.

2008-02-18  Stas

	* [r1836] src/base/dev/dma/dmanew.c, src/base/dev/sb16/sb16.c:
	  OK, the good-bye cannot be that rude any more. My apologies to the
	  sound.c authors for that silly remark of mine and I hope you can do a
	  good work on my code.

2007-12-06  Bart

	* [r1835] src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c:
	  Use fpregset_t instead of _fpstate to avoid problems with Debian's
	  glibc for x86_64.

2007-09-24  Bart

	* [r1834] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.h,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.h:
	  Replace BT24 and BTA inline asm by C.

2007-09-23  Bart

	* [r1833] src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Michael Karcher: #1800717 cpuemu: BOUND is signed. The current bound
	  implementation does a signed compare instead of an unsigned one. This
	  patch should fix it.

	* [r1832] src/base/async/int.c, src/base/dev/misc/lpt.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Implement the bound instruction (albeit fully interpreted). Make sure
	  that int 5 does not try printscreen if there is no printer.

	* [r1831] src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  From Michael Karcher: #1763170 CPU emu: implement INTO correctly. The
	  INTO instruction should generate the overflow execption only if the
	  overflow flag is set, not on every invocation.

	* [r1830] src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  From Michael Karcher: SF #1763169 CPU emu: handle prefixed jumps
	  correctly: The distance in a (not 8-bit) jump instruction is encoded
	  according to operand size, not address size. There is some wrong
	  documentation in this regard, even the processor reference manual I
	  usually use. The size of CX used in JCXZ is depending on the address
	  size, as correctly implemented in dosemu.

	* [r1829] src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  From Michael Karcher, #1763166 CPU emu: ignore access to unknown VGA
	  ports Currently, dosemu crashes on read/write access to unhandled
	  ports in the VGA range when cpuemu is enabled. While this is
	  acceptable behaviour while developing, it is not helpful for the end
	  user, who has a program probing for different SVGA cards by direct
	  hardware access.

2007-06-11  Bart

	* [r1828] src/dosext/mfs/lfn.c, src/tools/Makefile:
	  Fixed some warnings with 64-bit builds.

2007-06-05  Bart

	* [r1827] etc/global.conf, src/plugin/X/X.c:
	  Fix $_X_winsize; also enable to use it, and X_aspect_43 with text
	  modes with bitmapped fonts.

2007-06-04  Bart

	* [r1826] src/dosext/dpmi/msdos.c:
	  Add DPMI API translation support for int21/ax=71a6.

	* [r1825] src/base/async/int.c, src/dosext/mfs/lfn.c,
	  src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c, src/dosext/mfs/mfs.h, src/include/dos2linux.h:
	  Implement the LFN handle functions int21/ax=5704,5,6,7, and 71a6.
	  Also avoid using the set attribute ioctl on non-FAT filesystems.

2007-06-03  Bart

	* [r1824] dist/dosemu:
	  Correct dosemu script.

	* [r1823] src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c:
	  Fix SDL video mode chooser if only one mode is available.

	* [r1822] src/plugin/X/X.c:
	  Fix "dosemu -w" for X and error messages for $DISPLAY not set.

	* [r1821] src/plugin/kbd_unicode/keymaps.c, src/plugin/term/terminal.c:
	  Prompt if the keyboard layout can't be auto-detected. Initialize the
	  SLang terminal screen draw routines as late as possible (the first
	  time something needs to be drawn) so that other error messages can
	  still be seen on the normal (non-SLang) terminal screen.

	* [r1820] dist/dosemu, dist/dosemu.bindist, dist/dosemu.systemwide,
	  man/dosemu.bin.1.in, src/arch/linux/Makefile.main,
	  src/base/init/config.c, src/include/emu.h, src/plugin/X/X.c,
	  src/plugin/X/X_font.c, src/plugin/term/terminal.c:
	  Move xset functionality to obtain the X fonts and the terminal < 25
	  lines warnings from dosemu to dosemu.bin.

2007-06-01  Bart

	* [r1819] src/base/async/int.c, src/base/bios/int10.c,
	  src/base/dev/pic/pic.c, src/base/init/config.c,
	  src/base/init/parser.y.in, src/base/misc/dump.c,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c, src/dosext/mfs/mfs.h,
	  src/dosext/misc/xms.c, src/dosext/net/net/pktnew.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c, src/include/Asm/vm86.h,
	  src/include/machcompat.h:
	  Change longs in vm86.h to ints to be consistent between x86-64 and
	  i386.

	* [r1818] src/base/bios/int10.c, src/env/video/crtcemu.c,
	  src/env/video/seqemu.c, src/env/video/vgaemu.c:
	  Fix VESA text modes (fixes SR#1728817).

2007-05-30  Bart

	* [r1817] src/plugin/commands/generic.S:
	  Fix preprocessor confusion.

2007-05-28  Bart

	* [r1816] src/base/async/int.c, src/base/misc/dos2linux.c,
	  src/dosext/mfs/mangle.h, src/dosext/mfs/util.c,
	  src/include/dos2linux.h, src/plugin/X/X.c, src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c,
	  src/plugin/term/terminal.c, src/plugin/translate/include/translate.h,
	  src/plugin/translate/translate.c:
	  Better fix for X window titles & UTF-8. The title is now passed to
	  the plugin using a wchar_t string.

2007-05-25  Bart

	* [r1815] src/dosext/mfs/lfn.c, src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c,
	  src/dosext/mfs/mfs.h:
	  Let find_file report FILE_NOT_FOUND or PATH_NOT_FOUND in an extra
	  parameter depending on whether the directory where the file to be
	  searched would be in exists or not.

2007-05-23  Bart

	* [r1814] src/base/init/parser.y.in, src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c,
	  src/env/video/vgaemu.c:
	  Fix a memory leak and some other issues found by Valgrind.

2007-05-21  Bart

	* [r1813] src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c:
	  CPUEMU: do not mix up LDT accesses with emulator page faults, and
	  translate non-zero based DPMI addresses to the correct pointer.

2007-05-18  Bart

	* [r1812] etc/global.conf, src/base/init/lexer.l.in,
	  src/base/init/parser.y.in, src/env/video/vesa.c, src/include/emu.h:
	  Use vgaemubios_file internally to get the Bochs BIOS to avoid mixing
	  up with using it with console graphics, and be able to run it in a
	  non-root console.

	* [r1811] src/doc/README/config, src/plugin/X/screen.c,
	  src/plugin/kbd_unicode/include/keyb_clients.h,
	  src/plugin/kbd_unicode/keyb_clients.c,
	  src/plugin/translate/config/plugin_parser,
	  src/plugin/translate/include/translate.h,
	  src/plugin/translate/translate_config.c:
	  Improve pasting in X into DOSEMU too, trying to ask for UTF-8, then
	  iso2022, and then iso8859-1. This obsoletes the use of
	  $_external_char_set for pasting.

	* [r1810] src/base/async/int.c:
	  Add forgotten init memset of mbstate_t unix_state to 0. Fixes crash
	  on x86-64.

	* [r1809] src/env/video/text.c, src/include/vgatext.h,
	  src/plugin/X/screen.c:
	  Improving pasting text from DOSEMU: follow guidelines about which
	  character sets to use (in practise we must usually convert to UTF8
	  nowadays).

	* [r1808] src/plugin/kbd_unicode/keyb_clients.c:
	  Check for -1 return from character_count (if an invalid multibyte
	  character string is pasted for example), so DOSEMU won't crash.

	* [r1807] src/base/bios/int10.c:
	  Add missing semicolon in int10.c

	* [r1806] src/arch/linux/debugger/mhpdbgc.c, src/base/async/int.c,
	  src/base/misc/disks.c, src/base/misc/fatfs.c,
	  src/base/misc/userhook.c, src/base/misc/utilities.c,
	  src/dosext/mfs/lfn.c, src/dosext/mfs/mangle.c,
	  src/dosext/mfs/mangle.h, src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c,
	  src/dosext/mfs/mscdex.c, src/dosext/mfs/util.c,
	  src/include/dos2linux.h, src/include/utilities.h,
	  src/plugin/commands/builtins.c, src/plugin/commands/commands.c,
	  src/plugin/commands/dosdbg.c, src/plugin/commands/lredir.c,
	  src/plugin/commands/msetenv.c, src/plugin/commands/xmode.c:
	  Force within-ASCII uppercasing for ASCII letters for toupperDOS and
	  friends. Consistently use toupperDOS etc. functions instead of
	  toupper etc. to avoid problems with the dotless i as used in Turkish
	  and some other languages. In fatfs.c convert from the Linux to the
	  DOS character set, and vice versa for the X title display.

2007-05-17  Bart

	* [r1805] src/base/bios/bios.S:
	  Always covert ax=6cxx to 6c00 for the int21/ah=6c LFN->DOS converter.

2007-05-16  Bart

	* [r1804] src/env/video/vesa.c:
	  Allow larger Bochs vgabios'es to be used than 32K.

2007-05-14  Bart

	* [r1803] src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Implemented lock prefix (either ignored, or illegal op).

2007-05-13  Bart

	* [r1802] src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c:
	  SIMX86: Don't try to stretch time using RDTSC if $_rdtsc=(off)

	* [r1801] src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Push IOPL_MASK on the stack for pushf and int. Fixes vm86 mode
	  detection of DOS4GW when $_dpmi=(off).

	* [r1800] src/arch/linux/async/signal.c:
	  Revert DPMI-inability detection change from #1799.

	* [r1799] src/arch/linux/async/signal.c,
	  src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.h, src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c,
	  src/env/video/vgaemu.c:
	  When handling signals, check for a valid DPMI selector, which means
	  that it is an LDT selector and not reserved by glibc or similar, e.g.
	  for pthreads. Else, and that includes the whole GDT, assume we
	  interrupt DOSEMU code. SystemSelector() in DPMI now refers to
	  anything not covered by the above, plus dpmi_sel16 & dpmi_sel32. This
	  fixes crashes with Xen-DOM0 on x86-64 where cs is 0x33 on entry to
	  signal handlers but set to 0xe033 after the first syscall.

2007-05-11  Bart

	* [r1798] src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Remove (replace by an e_printf) debug code that aborts CPUEMU if 4 or
	  more 0's in a row are executed. Some .com programs do this to skip
	  over data (Reinhard Karcher).

	* [r1797] dist/dosemu, src/emu.c:
	  Moved DOSDRIVE_D environment manipulation from the dosemu script to
	  dosemu.bin so it also works with sudo.

	* [r1796] src/arch/linux/async/debug.c, src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c,
	  src/base/init/init.c:
	  Reorganize some debug reporting a bit. uname and the GCC version
	  number are now always reported in boot.log. Added some bug report
	  instructions.

	* [r1795] src/plugin/X/X.c, src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c,
	  src/plugin/term/term_core.c:
	  Fix terminal init problem (no terminal input running xdosemu) if no
	  dynamically linked plugins are used.

	* [r1794] default-configure:
	  Check the default bitness of gcc, instead of blindly relying on
	  uname.

	* [r1793] src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, src/emu-i386/cpu.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c, src/include/emu.h:
	  Implement some workarounds for the CPU ESP bug. It is unlikely that
	  it will be worked around in 64-bit kernels. Compare with segment
	  limits instead of what is supposed to be kernel space (it isn't on
	  x86-64). Fixes the ancient MS Linker and the Need For Speed demo on
	  x86-64.

2007-05-10  Bart

	* [r1792] src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c:
	  Do not patch code that has just tried to overwrite code instead of
	  data. Fixes a crash with Larry.

2007-05-09  Bart

	* [r1791] src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c:
	  As the read-only attribute is mostly ignored for directories in DOS,
	  the dos_would_allow check for writable directories doesn't make much
	  sense. Instead simply check if the file is writable.

	* [r1790] src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c:
	  It is possible to work around the x86-64 FAT compat-ioctl kernel bug.
	  Thanks to Wine.

2007-05-08  Bart

	* [r1789] src/arch/linux/async/signal.c, src/emu.c:
	  Force $_cpu_emu="full", and do not crash, if %cs is not saved for
	  signal handlers on x86-64 (kernels < 2.6.15, #1713659).

	* [r1788] src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/midid/oss.c,
	  src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/midid/timid.c,
	  src/plugin/midimisc/mid_o_oss.c:
	  Declare *seqbuf_dump static before including soundcard.h. Hopefully
	  that solves all warnings and errors with the variations out there.

	* [r1787] src/plugin/kbd_unicode/keymaps.c:
	  Do not attempt to load the X plugin if X isn't compiled.

	* [r1786] src/dosext/mfs/lfn.c:
	  int21/ax=7160/cl=1,2 must return an error if the file does not exist.
	  Fixes problems with FreeCOM mkdir not preserving the LFN directory
	  name.

	* [r1785] src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c:
	  Ignore attempts to translate the archive and read-only attributes to
	  Unix permissions for directories. Fixes problem with pkunzip (Joe
	  Ripley, linux-msdos).

2007-05-07  Bart

	* [r1784] dist/autoexec.bat, dist/config.sys, src/base/async/int.c,
	  src/plugin/commands/blaster.c:
	  Reduce lines of output in config.sys, autoexec.bat, blaster, and the
	  banner, so everything fits on 25 lines.

	* [r1783] src/dosext/mfs/lfn.c:
	  Fix more illegal writes in the LFN code (crashed DJGPP gcc with
	  cpuemu=vm86).

2007-05-06  Bart

	* [r1782] Makefile, Makefile.conf.in, src/Makefile.common,
	  src/arch/linux/Makefile.main, src/commands/Makefile:
	  Speed up 'make' a bit: - don't use bash anymore; remove bash-isms and
	  eliminate pwd -P - don't use the intermediate tmp directory for make
	  install anymore - use -rR make flags to ignore built-ins and made
	  some built-ins explicit

	* [r1781] configure, configure.ac, src/plugin/kbd_unicode/configure,
	  src/plugin/sdl/configure:
	  Execute sub-configures by hand to avoid autoconf warnings and
	  possible future breakage.

	* [r1780] Makefile.conf.in, configure, configure.ac, default-configure:
	  Allow dash to be used as sh in out-of-tree builds.

	* [r1779] Makefile.conf.in:
	  Do not forget sndfile and alsa libraries when building without
	  dynamically loaded plugins.

	* [r1778] src/base/bios/int10.c:
	  Implement INT10/AH=1c (save/restore video state)

2007-05-05  Bart

	* [r1776] ChangeLog, NEWS, dist/config.sys, dist/dosemu.bindist,
	  dist/mkbindist:
	  Last minute fix for 1.4.0: fix #1713278 COMSPEC setting wrong. Use
	  config.sys/autoexec.bat distributed from here in the bindist instead
	  of the one in dosemu-freedos-*-bin*.

	* [r1775] NEWS, ChangeLog:
	  Release 1.4.0.

	* [r1774] INSTALL, README, README.bindist, doc/README.txt,
	  doc/announce, src/base/init/install.c, src/doc/README/config,
	  src/doc/README/header:
	  More documentation updates; added a quick more basic introduction at
	  the beginning of README.txt.

2007-05-04  Bart

	* [r1773] VERSION, doc/DANG.txt, doc/README-tech.txt, doc/README.txt,
	  doc/announce, doc/dosemu-HOWTO.txt, etc/dosemu.conf,
	  src/doc/DANG/DANG.sgml, src/doc/HOWTO/dosemu-HOWTO.sgml,
	  src/doc/README/Priv-usage, src/doc/README/SECURITY,
	  src/doc/README/config, src/doc/README/port-io,
	  src/doc/README/recover, src/doc/README/runasuser:
	  Documentation updates for 1.4.0.

	* [r1772] src/dosext/mfs/lfn.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c,
	  src/plugin/commands/lredir.c:
	  gcc-2.95 compatibility fixes.

	* [r1771] src/base/init/config.c, src/emu-i386/ports.c:
	  Convert error about direct port i/o without root into a warning.
	  Err about using "-s" without enough privileges.

	* [r1770] src/arch/linux/Makefile.main:
	  Fix man page out-of-tree building.

	* [r1769]  (almost all files changed)
	  Update copyright line to 2007.

	* [r1768] dosemu.spec.in:
	  Added missing new directory and symbolic link to dosemu.spec.

	* [r1767] src/arch/linux/Makefile.main:
	  Make man files at "make" instead of "make install" time.

	* [r1766] dist/dosemu, dist/dosemu.bindist, dist/mkbindist,
	  man/dosemu.bin.1.in, src/arch/linux/Makefile.main,
	  src/base/init/config.c, src/base/init/install.c,
	  src/base/init/parser.y.in, src/base/misc/fatfs.c:
	  Allow --Flibdir for suid configurations, as it hasn't been used to
	  locate global.conf for years. Document the allowance for
	  --Flibdir/--Fimagedir. Repair bindist/mkbindist to work with the 
	  new FreeDOS configuration. This means using --Flibdir and
	  $DOSEMU_LIB_DIR instead of the hardcode DOSEMULIB_DEFAULT.
	  Run mkfontdir at "make" instead of "make install" time when possible.

	* [r1765] src/plugin/commands/lredir.c:
	  Fix lredir c: d:

2007-05-03  Bart

	* [r1764] configure, configure.ac, src/plugin/sdl/Makefile:
	  Fix forgotten make distclean file in SDL plugin; add -lXext for
	  Xxf86vm checking on certain systems.

	* [r1763] INSTALL, configure, configure.ac:
	  Check for the existence of the Xxf86vm and Xext libraries, not just
	  header files. Adjust INSTALL instructions.

	* [r1762] config.guess, config.sub, configure, configure.ac:
	  Don't use -mtune by default. It doesn't bear much relation to 'uname
	  -m' anymore on anything newer than a Pentium Pro.

	* [r1761] etc/dosemu.users.example, src/base/init/config.c,
	  src/base/init/parser.y.in, src/base/misc/priv.c, src/include/priv.h:
	  Register the difference between sudo and suid-root.
	  Use c_all as the default for users who run dosemu via sudo so
	  dosemu.users does not need to be edited for that case, leaving
	  the default "restricted" (only console graphics at the console,
	  no remote direct hardware access) setting for suid-root.

2007-05-02  Bart

	* [r1760] src/arch/linux/Makefile.main:
	  Use -rm instead of rm to deal with non-existing directories.
	  Use bdftopcf at make time instead of make install.
	  Fixes problems reported at linux-msdos (perry hargrave).

	* [r1759] src/base/init/parser.y.in:
	  Repair $_sound=(on). You would only get the old sound driver via
	  $_sound=(1).

2007-05-01  Bart

	* [r1758] src/env/video/dualmon.c, src/env/video/hgc.c,
	  src/env/video/matrox.c, src/env/video/vc.c:
	  Mark all mapped video memory PROT_EXEC, similar to the VGAEMU memory.
	  Solves a few problems with console video on x86-64.

	* [r1757] src/emu-i386/simx86/fp87-x86.c:
	  Use aliased memory for emulation of FSTENV/FSAVE.

	* [r1756] src/emu-i386/simx86/cpatch.c:
	  There is a slight chance that the CPUEMU cpatch stubs hit VGA memory.
	  For that case there is a simple instruction decoder but we must use
	  explicit assembly instructions. Fixes another problem with Norton
	  SysInfo.

2007-04-30  Bart

	* [r1755] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c:
	  Fix regression in vgaemu handling from #1754.
	  Fix problem with rep movs with df set backwards for simulated cpuemu
	  with planar VGA modes.

	* [r1754] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c, src/env/video/vgaemu.c:
	  Fix problems with programs that try to access unmapped VGA memory or
	  write to ROM in CPUEMU, such as Norton SysInfo.

2007-04-29  Bart

	* [r1753] src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c:
	  Check for FAT filesystem before attempting to use the VFAT ioctls.
	  Also check if the first entry is ".\0" to avoid an ioctl32 bug in
	  kernels <= 2.6.21.1.

2007-04-27  Bart

	* [r1751] VERSION, NEWS, ChangeLog, doc/DOSEMU-HOWTO.txt,
	  etc/dosemu.conf:
	  Regenerate documentation. Release 1.3.5.

	* [r1750] src/plugin/commands/lredir.c, src/plugin/commands/msetenv.c:
	  Avoid CPUEMU problems with msetenv. Only set DOSEMU_LASTREDIR if no
	  drive letter was given; improve lredir command line processing with C
	  and R.

	* [r1749] etc/dosemu.conf, src/base/dev/misc/lpt.c:
	  Flush every second when printing. Fix $_lptx="" to not register any
	  ports.

	* [r1748] src/dosext/dpmi/msdos.c:
	  Fix #1638135 (int 21h, ax=6300 not translated currently, japheth)

	* [r1747] src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c, src/dosext/mfs/mfs.h:
	  Always return . and .. as the first two entries for
	  findfirst/findnext to be consistent with real DOS. On Linux they
	  can be somewhere in the middle.

2007-04-26  Bart

	* [r1746] src/base/misc/dos2linux.c, src/include/dos2linux.h,
	  src/plugin/commands/lredir.c, src/plugin/commands/unix.c:
	  Apply #1691712 make lredir able to automatically choose next free
	  drive II (Stuart Axon)

	* [r1745] INSTALL:
	  Made a note about libXxf86vm (#1644784)

	* [r1744] man/dosemu.1.in:
	  [ 1692149 ] Describe --version in man page (fix for 1245033) (Stuart
	  Axon)

	* [r1743] src/doc/HOWTO/dosemu-HOWTO.sgml:
	  Some HOWTO updates by Stuart Axon (#1692299).

	* [r1742] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen.h,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/cpatch.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/tables.c:
	  Handle 16bit address overflow in cpuemu string instructions.
	  (#1683078, slightly adjusted from Michael Karcher's patch)

2007-04-23  Bart

	* [r1741] src/base/init/config.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.h, src/emu-i386/cpu.c, src/include/cpu.h,
	  src/include/emu.h:
	  Use fxsave/fxrstor when available on i386 to deal with SSE fp.
	  Make sure the fxsave buffer is paragraph aligned (fixes a bug with
	  DJGPP gcc on x86_64).

2007-04-22  Bart

	* [r1740] src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	  Check fs/gs values before loading them on x86-64. Preserves 64 bit
	  segment bases on Intel chips (but apparently makes no difference on
	  AMD's).

2007-04-20  Bart

	* [r1739] src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	  Fix LFB w/console graphics for x86-64.

	* [r1738] src/base/async/pci_bios.c, src/base/dev/misc/pci.c,
	  src/env/video/matrox.c, src/include/pci.h:

	* [r1737] src/emu-i386/do_vm86.c, src/include/cpu.h:
	  Use fnsave instead of fsave for saving the FPU state. Should fix
	  #1436788.

	* [r1736] src/plugin/term/keyb_slang.c,
	  src/plugin/translate/charsets/utf8.c:
	  Fix problems with utf-8 multibyte input in terminals (reported by
	  Grigory Batalov, linux-msdos).

2007-03-29  Bart

	* [r1735] dist/dosemu, src/base/init/config.c:
	  Avoid bash-ism "exec -a"; use an environment variable instead.

	* [r1734] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c:
	  Fix gcc warning.

	* [r1733] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c:

	  #1687298)

2007-03-24  Bart

	* [r1731] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/tables.c:

2007-03-11  Bart

	* [r1726] src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Use leavedos(1) for EMU86 failure to drop into dosdebug; improve
	  diagnostics. For rep outs, use not_permitted and let the port code
	  deal with it instead of quitting DOSEMU.

	* [r1725] src/emu-i386/simx86/cpatch.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.c:
	  Break node if current eip is in a page to be unprotected; fixes bug
	  #1678581

2007-03-10  Bart

	* [r1724] src/dosext/mfs/dosc.c, src/dosext/mfs/lfn.c:
	  LFN: avoid writing to write-protected memory (thanks Michael Karcher)

	* [r1723] src/base/bios/setup.c, src/base/init/init.c,

	  src/plugin/sdl/snd_o_SDL.c:
	  Add forgotten files from Stas' new sound code.

	* [r1720] src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/midid/io.c,
	  src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/midid/midid.c,
	  src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/midid/timid.c:

	  Integrate most of Stas' new sound code, for now run-time selectable
	  using $_sound = (2).

	  src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/midid/seqops.h,
	  src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/midid/timid.c:
	  Merged trivial changes and makefile improvements from Stas' new midid
	  code.

	* [r1715] src/arch/linux/Makefile.main:
	  Do not erase all previous FreeDOS files when upgrading. Remove risky
	  comment between semicolons.

2006-11-22  Bart

	* [r1714] src/plugin/sdl/keyb_SDL.c:
	  Fix AltGr handling with SDL. It was confused with ScrollLock.

	* [r1713] src/plugin/sdl/keyb_SDL.c:
	  Try to use keysyms where possible in the SDL keyboard code.
	  Implemented workaround for altgr and broken unicode support in older
	  SDL versions.

2006-11-21  Bart

	* [r1712] src/plugin/X/X.c:
	  Fix double mouse cursor problem with Arachne.

	  src/doc/README/CDROM, doc/DANG.txt, doc/README.cpuemu,
	  doc/README.txt, doc/EMUfailure.txt:
	  Added CDROM lredir documentation. Regenerate documentation.
	  Release 1.3.4.

	* [r1709] src/arch/linux/async/debug.c, src/base/init/lexer.l.in,
	  src/base/misc/fatfs_boot.S, src/base/misc/utilities.c,

	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c, src/include/cpu.h:
	  GCC-2.95 and x86-64 VXD compatibility changes.

	* [r1708] INSTALL, src/base/init/install.c:
	  Fixed -install for other DOSes than the supplied FreeDOS and
	  adjust README.

2006-11-16  Bart

	* [r1707] src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c:
	  Fixed some 64-bit rip usage, and the division by zero exception.

	* [r1706] configure, configure.ac, src/include/config.h.in,
	  src/include/dlmalloc.h:
	  Fixed gcc warning in dlmalloc and removed some obsolete autoconf
	  macros.

2006-11-15  Bart

	* [r1705] src/arch/linux/Makefile.main:
	  Rearranged the messages after make install, so it is more clear
	  that the FreeDOS tarball is missing.

	* [r1704] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/modrm-gen.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/protmode.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/protmode.h,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/tables.c:
	  Segment handling and address calculation optimizations for
	  cpuemu.

2006-11-14  Bart

	* [r1703] configure, configure.ac:
	  Added configure checks for bdftopcf and mkfontdir.

	* [r1702] dist/dosemu:
	  Allow DOSDRIVE_D to be overridden.

	* [r1701] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/tables.c:

2006-11-13  Bart

	* [r1700] ChangeLog, NEWS:
	  Updated NEWS and ChangeLog

2006-11-12  Bart

	* [r1699] COPYING.DOSEMU, src/env/video/vgafonts.c:
	  Added VGA font and dlmalloc copyrights for completeness.

	* [r1698] dist/autoemu.bat, dist/autoexec.bat, dist/config.emu,
	  dist/config.sys, src/arch/linux/Makefile.main,
	  src/base/init/install.c, src/base/misc/fatfs.c:
	  The previous approach had circular symbolic links for directories
	  which is bad as it confuses DOS programs. It seems clearer to
	  create a drive_z directory with contents equal to the old freedos
	  directory (even though there may not be a freedos present).

	* [r1697] dist/dosemu, src/base/init/config.c,
	  src/base/init/install.c, src/emu.c, src/include/dos2linux.h,
	  src/include/emu.h, src/plugin/commands/unix.c:
	  Create no-prompt initial boot for DOSEMU+FreeDOS with a welcome
	  screen. The liability disclaimer just needs to be confirmed.
	  Removed the win4lin check from the dosemu script and moved the
	  terminal instructions to the main code.

	* [r1696] dist/autoemu.bat, dist/autoexec.bat, dist/config.emu,
	  dist/config.sys, dosemu.spec.in, src/arch/linux/Makefile.main,
	  src/base/init/install.c, src/base/misc/fatfs.c:
	  Remove the tarballs with symlinks. Instead, point d: to the
	  systemwide FreeDOS directory during config.sys processing and use
	  z: after that. Install config.sys et al from dosemu.

	* [r1695] etc/dosemu.conf, etc/global.conf,
	  src/base/dev/misc/lpt.c, src/base/init/lexer.l.in,
	  src/base/init/parser.y.in:
	  Use $_lpt1, $_lpt2, and $_lpt3 for printer configuration and
	  disable the printer IRQ for now since it's not used. Fixes
	  #1492201.

	* [r1694] src/base/async/int.c, src/base/bios/setup.c,
	  src/include/int.h:
	  Fix missing LFN support after ctrl-alt-del (#1487899)

	* [r1693] INSTALL, compiletime-settings,
	  compiletime-settings.devel, compiletime-settings.help, configure,
	  configure.ac, default-configure, src/emu.c,
	  src/plugin/sdl/acinclude.m4, src/plugin/sdl/configure,
	  src/plugin/sdl/configure.ac:
	  Use JIT cpuemu by default on x86-64, and don't force -m32 any
	  longer. Introduce target_bits compile time option to optionally
	  set -m32 or -m64. Updated SDL configure script and added a link
	  check for cross-compilation.

2006-11-11  Bart

	* [r1692] dist/dosemu:
	  Use `id -ur` instead of $UID for dash compatibility.

	* [r1691] src/arch/linux/async/signal.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/emu-i386/cpu.c, src/include/cpu-emu.h:
	  Fix compilation with cpuemu off.

	* [r1690] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.h,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.h, src/emu-i386/simx86/emu86.h,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c, src/env/video/instremu.c,
	  src/env/video/vgaemu.c, src/include/vgaemu.h:
	  Implemented better VGAEMU support for simulated cpuemu and
	  eliminated the e_vga_base and e_vga_end variables.

	* [r1689] src/arch/linux/async/signal.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c, src/emu.c, src/env/video/vc.c,
	  src/include/emu.h, src/plugin/term/terminal.c:
	  Handle all async signals except those that call leavedos using
	  sigasync() which calls the correct sighandler using a function
	  pointer array. The real signal handlers are all set in
	  signal.c:signal_init() now. Add SIGWINCH & SIGPROF to the queue
	  block list because of their nature.

	* [r1688] src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.c:
	  Fixed some issues with self-modifying code.

	* [r1687] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/tables.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.c:
	  Removed GenBufSize hack and adjusted the op size array.

	* [r1686] src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c, src/env/video/instremu.c,
	  src/include/cpu.h:
	  Avoid "lahf" (may not be available on x86-64) and use READ_BYTE
	  for IS_IRET.

2006-11-10  Bart

	* [r1685] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.c:
	  Fixed a bug in InvalidateSingleNode and DPMI TheCPU.eflags
	  handling. Under normal circumstances IOPL should never be set
	  there.

	* [r1684] configure, configure.ac:
	  Add -lm to LIBS as DOSEMU now uses a few math functions.

	* [r1683] src/emu-i386/simx86/fp87-sim.c:
	  Fixed rounding to integer in the FPU simulator.

	* [r1682] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c:
	  Fix das/aas/aam for x86-64.

	* [r1681] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/fp87-sim.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Fixed ENTER/IDIV/DIV/IMUL/DAS and some FPU cases that failed with
	  the QEMU i386 emulator test program.

	* [r1680] src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Correct ofsseg array for DPMI

2006-11-08  Bart

	* [r1679] src/emu.c, src/include/emu.h:
	  Forgotten sigjmp_buf declarations from r1677.

	* [r1678] src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c:
	  Enable X background pause for SDL

	* [r1677] src/base/misc/utilities.c, src/emu.c:
	  Use sigsetjmp/siglongjmp because signal handlers may be involved
	  in leavedos.

	* [r1676] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c:
	  Fix BSF and BSR, and don't use code patches for DPMI code for
	  cpuemu="full". Fixes Duke Nukem 3D in this mode.

	* [r1675] src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Use the operand size instead of the address size for jump
	  destination masking. Fixes some issues with cpuemu in DPMI.

	* [r1674] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c:
	  Fix vgaemu in compiled code.

	* [r1673] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Fixed IMUL regressions from r1670.

2006-11-07  Bart

	* [r1672] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Use load/op/store for inc&dec, and optimize inc/dec byte reg.

	* [r1671] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Use load/op/store for xchg and actually use xchg in generated
	  code as well.

	* [r1670] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Use load/op/store for cpuemu (I)MUL, (I)DIV, NEG, and NOT.

	* [r1669] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen.h,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Use "op %al,reg" style instructions in cpuemu instead of "op
	  (%edi),%al" to avoid certain VGA memory reads.

	* [r1668] src/base/misc/dump.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	  Fixed a DPMI ctrl-c problem (missed in_dpmi_dos_int), and avoid
	  dumping unreachable memory in dump.c, which may double-fault.

2006-11-06  Bart

	* [r1667] src/dosext/dpmi/memory.c:
	  Save actual dpmi base pointer in config.dpmi_base.

	* [r1666] src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/fp87-x86.c:
	  Changed fp87 absolute addresses to bx-relative so that the FPU
	  works for x86-64 for JIT cpuemu, and improve x86-64 cpuemu fault
	  handling.

	* [r1665] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.c:
	  Fixed VGA read/write for x86-64. Misc adjustments to deal with
	  64-bit pointers. Add forgotten #include.

2006-11-05  Bart

	* [r1664] src/base/misc/Makefile, src/base/misc/dlmalloc.c,
	  src/base/misc/smalloc.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/memory.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.c,
	  src/include/dlmalloc.h, src/include/smalloc.h:
	  Use Doug Lea's malloc (forced to use mmap with PROT_EXEC) instead
	  of smalloc for cpuemu. It is a lot faster.

	* [r1663] src/base/misc/smalloc.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/memory.c,
	  src/include/smalloc.h:
	  Introduce smalloc_fast and smfree_fast: these clobber the
	  allocated memory to improve the speed of smfree (eliminating a
	  linear search). Used by cpuemu: shaves ~25% off DOS boot time.

	* [r1662] src/base/misc/smalloc.c, src/include/smalloc.h:
	  Changed smalloc to use a double-linked list for a little
	  performance improvement.

	* [r1661] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.h:
	  Clean up HOST_ARCH_X86 use.

	* [r1660] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen.h,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/cpatch.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/syncpu.h:
	  Implemented stos/movs patches for x86-64.

	* [r1659] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.h:
	  Pass clink as a pointer instead of as a possibly truncated int.

	* [r1658] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.h:
	  Clean up pointer casts in cpuemu tree handling. Use int instead
	  of long where possible/appropriate.

2006-11-04  Bart

	* [r1657] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.h, src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen.h,

	  src/emu-i386/simx86/syncpu.h, src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.c:
	  Implemented stack/write code patches for x86-64 and fixed an
	  associated bug in trees.c.

	* [r1656] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen.h, src/emu-i386/simx86/cpatch.c,

	  src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/syncpu.h:
	  Reorganised the SynCPU structure and rep stos/movs code patches
	  to use call (%ebx), and enable those on x86-64.

2006-11-02  Bart

	* [r1655] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.h, src/emu-i386/simx86/cpatch.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/emu86.h:
	  Cleaned up cpuemu eflags handling. DF is now always handled via
	  TheCPU.eflags instead of the stack flag image, and always clear
	  between instructions. Disabled the pushf VIF trick which doesn't
	  seem to work as advertised.

	* [r1654] src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Correct cpuemu regression from rev #1652

2006-11-01  Bart

	* [r1653] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c:
	  Correct flag handling in AAA, AAS, DAS, DAA, CMPS*, SCAS* in the
	  cpuemu interpreter. Fixes problems with FD DEBUG's "a" command.

	* [r1652] src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	  Fix single stepping in cpu-emu (including dosdebug).

2006-10-31  Bart

	* [r1651] src/env/video/render.c, src/env/video/text.c,
	  src/include/render.h, src/plugin/X/X.c,
	  src/plugin/sdl/mouse_SDL.c, src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c:
	  Fix palette and mouse with SDL for fbdev/fullscreen/256 colors.

	* [r1650] (almost all files changed)
	  Update year to 2006. COPYING now contains the pure GPL, and
	  COPYING.DOSEMU the other copyright details. Distribute the GPL
	  and COPYING.DOSEMU with rpm's from dosemu.spec. Clarified the
	  clause on redistribution of repackaged official packages.

	* [r1649] src/plugin/X/X.c, src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c:
	  Don't call SDL_UpdateRects with 0 rectangles: it may crash. Fix
	  the close (x) window button in xdosemu.

2006-10-30  Bart

	* [r1648] src/env/video/text.c, src/plugin/X/X.c, src/plugin/X/X.h,
	  src/plugin/X/X_font.c, src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c:
	  Don't call X functions directly from SDL code, that won't work
	  with SDL libraries that are not directly linked with X. Added
	  more checks for x11.window availability. Fixed mouse/input focus
	  cursor blinking situation.

	* [r1647] src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c:
	  Initialize most of the X support before creating the first window
	  (except for window and font), where it was done previously.
	  Avoids some issues with dynamic loading.

	* [r1646] src/plugin/X/X_font.c:
	  Fix crash in SDL if X_font = "" (thanks Reinhard).

2006-10-29  Bart

	* [r1645] src/env/video/text.c, src/include/vgatext.h,
	  src/plugin/X/X.c, src/plugin/X/X_font.c, src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c:
	  Add X font support to the SDL plugin. There's a bit of a trick
	  involved (a second "Display") to receive all expose events. Did
	  some associated cleanup.

	* [r1644] src/plugin/X/Makefile, src/plugin/X/X.c,
	  src/plugin/X/X.h, src/plugin/X/X_font.c:
	  Moved X font handling into a seperate file with seperate static
	  variables, so X fonts can be used by SDL later.

	* [r1643] dist/dosemu:
	  Replace bash-isms in dosemu script with sh constructs.

	* [r1642] src/env/video/text.c, src/plugin/X/X.c:
	  Introduce a new Window in the X code, drawwindow, that is a
	  subwindow of either the fullscreen or the normal window, so can
	  be reparented (technique borrowed from SDL). The main advantage
	  is that the X server can take care of shift_x/shift_y for text
	  modes. Also no need to copy gc's any more. Fix crash for a too
	  eager update_cursor().

2006-10-28  Bart

	* [r1641] src/env/video/render.c, src/env/video/text.c,
	  src/include/render.h, src/include/vgatext.h, src/plugin/X/X.c,
	  src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c:
	  Create a "bitmap" text system in render.c that is shared by X and
	  SDL. Implemented line drawing (for mono underline) on the canvas.
	  The text cursor and underlining now go through the remapper on X.
	  Remove scaling from the previously used X calls (impossible with
	  X fonts). Screen updates now lock the surface during the whole
	  update for SDL; the SDL code pushes rectangles to be updated and
	  sends them in one go. Mode changes need to be checked before
	  locking the surface: moved the mode adjust calls out of the
	  common update code.

	* [r1640] src/arch/linux/async/signal.c, src/env/video/text.c,
	  src/include/vgatext.h, src/plugin/X/X.c, src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c,
	  src/plugin/term/terminal.c:
	  Remove update function in text_system struct. The only user was X
	  with XFlush but XFlush is not necessary if XPending is called
	  often enough. Moved event handler call in signal.c after update
	  calls to be sure of that. Similarly the mouse cursor update is
	  best placed before other updates.

	* [r1639] src/env/video/seqemu.c, src/env/video/text.c,
	  src/env/video/vesa.c, src/include/vgatext.h, src/plugin/X/X.c,
	  src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c, src/plugin/term/terminal.c:
	  Remove X_resize_text_screen from text_system structure. Resizes
	  are done on demand by update_screen(); set vga.reconfig.re_init
	  to be sure of that in all cases.

	* [r1638] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c:
	  Correct DAA & DAS in simulator.

	* [r1637] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c:
	  Implement AAD and AAM replacements for x86-64.

	* [r1636] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c:
	  Implement JIT code for AAA,AAS,DAA, and DAS for x86-64 as they
	  are not available in long mode. Fixes FreeDOS debug which uses
	  DAA, in particular.

2006-10-26  Bart

	* [r1635] src/base/init/parser.y.in,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.h, src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen.h,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c, src/emu.c, src/include/cpu-emu.h:
	  Enable dynamic code generation for x86-64. Almost all generated
	  code is the same as for i386, but it's still a bit unstable, and
	  slower than simulation because of excessive page faulting: code
	  patching isn't working yet. But FreeDOS boots. Only enabled for
	  $_cpu_emu="vm86", not for the default "off" for now. Marked
	  InCompiledCode as volatile to simplify asm constraints.

	* [r1634] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.h,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,

	  src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.c:
	  cpuemu: replaced use of inline asm __memcpy by memcpy. GCC does a
	  good job now and asm __memcpy isn't portable.

	* [r1633] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/fp87-x86.c:
	  cpuemu: fix asm compilation on x86-64.

2006-10-24  Bart

	* [r1632] src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c, src/plugin/commands/builtins.h:
	  Improve cpuemu fault handling and diagnostics; avoid a few more
	  page faults in DOSEMU code.

	* [r1631] src/base/init/config.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c, src/include/emu.h:
	  simx86: shortened asm code, check correct CPU feature flags for
	  prefetcht0, and fix DPMI Jazz Jackrabbit crash with
	  $_cpu_emu="vm86".

2006-10-23  Bart

	* [r1630] src/base/init/parser.y.in,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/cpatch.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c, src/include/cpu-emu.h:
	  Link in most of the JIT code for x86-64. Small crucial parts
	  still disabled.

	* [r1629] src/arch/linux/debugger/Makefile,
	  src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/midid/Makefile,
	  src/tools/periph/Makefile:
	  Use LDFLAGS without -rdynamic to link misc binaries.

	* [r1628] etc/dosemu.conf, src/base/init/lexer.l.in,
	  src/base/init/parser.y.in, src/emu-i386/simx86/Makefile,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-arch.h,

	  src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/trees.c,
	  src/include/cpu-emu.h, src/include/emu.h:
	  Select JIT or simulated CPU emulation at runtime instead of at
	  compiletime.

2006-10-22  Bart

	* [r1627] src/arch/linux/async/signal.c,
	  src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c, src/emu-i386/cpu.c,
	  src/include/emu.h:
	  Replaced tls_setup hack with something just a little cleaner. The
	  64bit fs and gs bases are restored in signal handlers. To avoid
	  an expensive syscall it is first checked if the bases really need
	  to be set by comparing the memory fs/gs and the original base
	  point to. There is a very small chance that that involves a page
	  fault, which needs to be fixed up.

	* [r1626] src/include/cpu.h:
	  Fix FPU save/restore on x86-64.

2006-10-20  Bart

	* [r1625] src/base/misc/Makefile, src/base/misc/fatfs.c,
	  src/base/misc/fatfs.h, src/base/misc/fatfs_boot.S:
	  Simplify linking in fatfs_boot.S, similar to bootsect.S before.

	* [r1624] src/tools/periph/Makefile, src/tools/periph/bootsect.S,
	  src/tools/periph/bootsect.h, src/tools/periph/mkfatimage.c,
	  src/tools/periph/mkfatimage16.c:
	  Link compiled bootsect.S directly into mkfatimage* instead of
	  using hex. Get rid of things that are overwritten in bootsect.S;
	  I can't find anything left (C) Peter Norton.

2006-10-19  Bart

	* [r1623] src/base/bios/Makefile, src/env/video/remap_asm.S:
	  Adjustments for older GCCs and 64-bit noexecstack.

	* [r1622] src/base/bios/Makefile, src/base/bios/bios.S,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmisel.S, src/env/video/Makefile,
	  src/env/video/remap_asm.S, src/env/video/vesabios.S,
	  src/env/video/vesabios_pm.S, src/include/macros86.h:
	  Added sections to assembly files to mark a non-executable stack.
	  (suggestion from James Courtier-Dutton, linux-msdos). For bios.S
	  and vesabios.S it was necessary to compile without intermediate
	  linking, which adds a few "-bios_f000"'s but simplifies Makefiles
	  considerably.

	* [r1621] src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	  Fix C problem with wrongly placed label.

	* [r1620] src/arch/linux/async/signal.c,
	  src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmisel.S, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmisel.h:
	  Use IRET to jump into DPMI client code on x86-64. It's nice
	  because it pops up ss:esp even for same-privilege transfers from
	  long mode. To avoid the infamous 16-bit stack ESP corruption
	  issue the iret stack frame is allocated at 0x100000000 or a
	  similar address with bits 16-31 zero.

2006-10-18  Bart

	* [r1619] src/arch/linux/async/signal.c,

	  src/include/cpu.h, src/include/emu.h, src/include/vm86plus.h,
	  src/plugin/term/terminal.c:
	  Cleaned up vm86plus.h. Created a new init_handler function in
	  signal.c which takes care of flags, %fs, %gs etc. dis8086 64-bit
	  compat. Create dpmi_iret_setup for exiting signal handlers to
	  DPMI client code.

	* [r1618] src/arch/linux/debugger/dis8086.c,
	  src/arch/linux/debugger/mhpdbgc.c, src/base/misc/dump.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c, src/env/video/instremu.c,
	  src/include/dis8086.h:
	  Replaced disassembler of unclearly licensed origin by one adapted
	  from 2asm via MAME and DOSBox.

2006-10-17  Bart

	* [r1617] src/plugin/commands/unix.c:
	  Fixed quiet switching for dosemu in dumb mode with a given
	  command.

2006-10-12  Bart

	* [r1616] src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmisel.S:
	  Improve direct DPMI switch jmp for x86-64: don't use instructions
	  that change flags after popf, eliminate use of r10, and tell gcc
	  that r8 and r9 are clobbered.

2006-10-11  Bart

	* [r1615] src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.h, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmisel.S,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmisel.h:
	  Removed sigsetjmp/longjmp usage for DPMI again. A tiny amount of
	  assembly can do it more efficiently (saves the sigprocmask
	  syscall that sigsetjmp makes).

2006-10-10  Bart

	* [r1614] src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmisel.S, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmisel.h,
	  src/emu-i386/cpu.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c:
	  Implemented native DPMI code execution for x86-64. Only tested
	  with a simple Openwatcom "wcc hello.c" but that works. It needed
	  a few workarounds involving %ss and in particular a nasty hack
	  for %fs (used for TLS).

	* [r1613] src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-x86.h,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen.h, src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/protmode.c, src/include/emu-ldt.h:
	  Change lots of long * to int * in CPUEMU. Now basic DPMI works
	  for $_cpu_emu="full" on x86-64.

	* [r1612] src/arch/linux/async/debug.c:
	  Add an extra backtrace without full (in case gdb with full
	  fails), and a simple backtrace using glibc backtrace(), for
	  suid-root.

	* [r1611] src/base/async/int.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/include/Asm/ldt.h:
	  Changed lots of longs to int in the DPMI and LDT code, and a few
	  for int15(extmem). Now DPMI LDT entry allocation works for 64bit.

	* [r1610] src/arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c:
	  Map DPMI, LFB, and hardware RAM high memory into the first 2G of
	  address space on x86-64 using MAP_32BIT.

	* [r1609] src/arch/linux/debugger/mhpdbgc.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c, src/include/mhpdbg.h:
	  Fix dosdebug (ldt, symbol reading) and cpu exception printf for
	  64-bit.

	* [r1608] src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-sim.c, src/include/bitops.h:
	  Replaced simulated BITOP code by non-self-modifying code, adding
	  the used change_bit and find_bit_r inline functions to bitops.h.
	  Some more long->int conversions for 64bit compatibility.

2006-10-08  Bart

	* [r1607] src/include/cpu.h, src/include/timers.h:
	  Fix rdtsc (fixes random slow-downs and hangs) and unix.com in
	  64-bit. Getting more usable.

	* [r1606] src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c:
	  Tweak fullscreen mode selection (for 320x200 you now get 640x400
	  instead of 640x350) in SDL, and work around a crash for fbdev
	  etc.

	* [r1605] src/plugin/X/X.c, src/plugin/X/screen.c,
	  src/plugin/X/screen.h, src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c:
	  Move X dependent part of copy/paste support into screen.c.
	  Support copy/paste with SDL/X11.

	* [r1604] src/plugin/X/X_keysyms.c, src/plugin/X/keyb_X_keycode.c:
	  Fix Alt-Gr handling with Xorg 7.1 (Reinhard & Michael Karcher)

	* [r1603] src/env/video/vc.c:
	  Fix i386 compilation.

	* [r1602] default-configure:

	  src/emu-i386/simx86/syncpu.h, src/env/video/vc.c,
	  src/include/cpu-emu.h, src/include/cpu.h, src/include/emu.h:
	  Implemented proper x86_64 signal handling. Have just one sigalrm
	  handler. Fix error() to not mysteriously give different output on
	  stderr compared to boot.log. Very basic stuff works now (freedos
	  dir/exitemu).

	* [r1600] src/base/misc/dump.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,

2006-10-07  Bart

	* [r1599] src/env/video/vgaemu.c, src/include/vgaemu.h:
	  Make vga.mem.scratch_page a void * to avoid having to shift all

2006-10-06  Bart

	* [r1595] src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.h,

	  First batch of x86-64 compatibility changes, mostly relating to
	  integer to pointer conversions. instremu is most affected.

2006-10-05  Bart

	* [r1594] src/arch/linux/Makefile.main:
	  Correct "tail +9" command to "tail -n +9". Closes #1516259.

	* [r1593] src/arch/linux/debugger/dis8086.c, src/dosext/misc/emm.c,
	  src/env/video/vc.c:
	  Fix gcc-4.2 warnings.

	* [r1592] src/arch/linux/mapping/mapfile.c,
	  src/arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c,
	  src/arch/linux/mapping/mapshm.c, src/base/misc/hma.c,

	  src/env/video/matrox.c, src/env/video/vc.c,
	  src/env/video/vgaemu.c, src/include/mapping.h:
	  Change mapping definitions to be more similar to the libc
	  prototypes, to save on casting (particularly for x86-64, later).
	  Handle alias maps via a separate alias_mapping() function because
	  here are two pointers instead of pointer + offset.

	* [r1591] src/include/memory.h:
	  Fix gcc warning in cmos.c.

	* [r1590] src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c:
	  Basic cpu-emu DPMI fixes. At least Jazz Jackrabbit starts now,
	  but it's still not very stable.

	* [r1589] src/arch/linux/async/signal.c,
	  src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.h, src/emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c,
	  src/include/cpu-emu.h, src/include/cpu.h:
	  Do not store the dpmi retcode in _eax any more, but return it
	  using the normal C mechanism. There are also some basic cpuemu
	  DPMI fixes.

2006-10-04  Bart

	* [r1588] src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.h, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmisel.S,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmisel.h:
	  Clean up unused returns, marking functions "noreturn". Move some
	  some more asm to dpmisel.S, and make dpmisel() as small as
	  possible. Using dpmisel() as %cs for the intermediate jmp just
	  confuses the selector checks so this isn't implemented after all.
	  Avoid various casts.

	* [r1587] src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.h, src/emu-i386/cpu.c,
	  src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c, src/env/video/vgaemu.c,
	  src/include/cpu.h:
	  Remove _emu_stack_frame. Use a special static eflags_fs_gs struct
	  to save and restore those, and handle the rest using the real CPU
	  segment registers, using asm macros.

	* [r1586] src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	  Eliminate one-time indirect DPMI switch to save FPU context. It's
	  not necessary any more after inheriting it from vm86.

2006-10-03  Bart

	* [r1585] src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, src/emu-i386/cpu.c,
	  src/emu-i386/do_vm86.c:
	  Do not save and restore the emulator FPU state (only VM86 and
	  DPMI states): savefpstate (fsave) also resets the current FPU
	  state which is good enough for calling FPU-using routines.

	* [r1584] src/base/dev/misc/rtc.c:
	  Replace 1e6 by 1000000: no need for floating point here.

	* [r1583] src/base/bios/bios.S, src/dosext/dpmi/Makefile,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmisel.S,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmisel.h, src/dosext/dpmi/msdos.c,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/vxd.c, src/include/bios.h:
	  Move all protected mode HLTs and the intermediate direct DPMI jmp
	  to a seperate memory area from the BIOS, and point dpmi_sel() to
	  that.

2006-10-01  Bart

	* [r1582] configure, configure.ac:
	  Better fix for configure (the previous one only worked with one
	  option).

2006-09-30  Bart

	* [r1581] configure, src/include/config.h.in,
	  src/plugin/kbd_unicode/configure,
	  src/plugin/kbd_unicode/include/kbd_unicode_config.h.in,
	  src/plugin/sdl/configure:
	  Regenerate autoconf-generated files with autoconf 2.60a.

	* [r1580] configure.ac:
	  Fix argument issue with calling default-configure from configure.

	* [r1579] src/base/init/lexer.l.in, src/base/init/parser.y.in:
	  Use strtoul to parse dosemu.conf numbers so that hardware ram etc
	  work with negative addresses.

	* [r1578] etc/dosemu.conf, src/arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c,
	  src/base/misc/utilities.c, src/dosext/dpmi/memory.c,
	  src/include/mapping.h, src/include/utilities.h:
	  Use non-zero mmap target addresses without MAP_FIXED. This avoids
	  the need to parse /proc/self/maps. Make (auto) the new default
	  for $_dpmi_base. Change dpmi_alloc_pool for $_dpmi_base=(auto) to
	  reject negative addresses; it will then try an address 128MB past
	  the current brk limit which is fairly close to the old default.

	* [r1577] src/arch/linux/mapping/mapfile.c, src/env/video/vgaemu.c:
	  Move VGAEMU LFB memory out of the shared memory pool (it can be
	  anonymous). Now the memory pool can be mmap'ed rw instead of rwx
	  (better protection with exec-shield); just the DOS-accessible
	  memory is rwx.

	* [r1576] src/arch/linux/mapping/mapfile.c:
	  Implemented workaround for failed PROT_EXEC on noexec shm mounts.

	* [r1575] src/arch/linux/async/signal.c,
	  src/arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.h:
	  Use sigsetjmp() and siglongjmp() to enter and return from DPMI,
	  instead of fiddling with CPU registers using assembly language,
	  greatly simplifying direct_dpmi_switch(). It will also be
	  portable to x86-64. The changes are as minimal as possible but
	  more cleanups can certainly be done (most of the _emu_stack_frame
	  can be eliminated for instance).

2006-09-28  Bart

	* [r1574] src/base/bios/bios.S, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/include/memory.h:
	  Use a special mmap'ed area for direct dpmi switching. This avoids
	  using the BIOS for data transfers and (wrt Stas' solution) has
	  the advantage of working with -fpic/pie

2006-04-29  Bart

	* [r1573] src/plugin/term/terminal.c:
	  Streamline terminal character write and ACS table construction
	  routines. Don't use ACS characters when it's not necessary (the
	  external charset already contains the required characters); this
	  helps with $_external_charset="cp437" on xterm -k8 -font vga
	  (Putty makes no difference). Only use ACS characters that are
	  specified by the relevant terminfo entry.

	* [r1572] src/plugin/X/X.c:
	  Enable use of unicode fonts for $_X_font, such as uni-vga, but
	  also misc-fixed*iso10646-1. The logic assumes DOS codepage
	  encoding for fonts with 256 or less characters, and UCS-16
	  otherwise.

	* [r1571] src/base/bios/bios.S, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/include/memory.h:
	  Apply %cs segment limit workaround for direct_dpmi_switch on
	  exec-shield kernels. Fixes #1478658: Crash on every DPMI program
	  under Linux 2.6.16.

2006-04-11  Bart

	* [r1570] src/include/pci.h:
	  Avoid problems with <sys/pci.h> by just defining the PCI_
	  constants ourselves.

	* [r1569] src/base/init/config.c:
	  Moved -2 -3 etc option parsing after config file parsing so they
	  actually work.

2006-03-11  Bart

	* [r1568] src/env/video/render.c:
	  Scale small modes towards ~640x400 (shows testcase for #1443448
	  in the right proportions)

2006-03-05  Bart

	* [r1567] src/emu-i386/cputime.c:
	  Fix TSC handling during DOSEMU freeze. Fixes #1441256 keyboard
	  issue (current cvs)

2006-03-04  Stas

	* [r1566] src/base/bios/bios.S, src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.h, src/dosext/dpmi/msdos.c,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/msdos.h, src/include/bios.h:
	  Preserve the PM regs unpon the realmode interrupts. That allows
	  to merge the msdos_pre_exec() with msdos_pre_extender(), and
	  msdos_post_exec() became completely unnecessary and removed. Also
	  cleaned up the dpmi_init() and removed the "psp" field from the
	  DPMI struct (msdos.c now handles PSP)

2006-03-04  Bart

	* [r1565] src/tools/periph/Makefile:
	  Fix dependency for bootsect.h after make distclean.

2006-03-04  Stas

	  Remove wrong env-mangling code (#1442375)

2006-03-04  Bart

	* [r1563] src/include/vc.h, src/tools/tools86.c:
	  Fix GCC warnings.

	* [r1562] src/commands/Makefile, src/plugin/commands/Makefile,
	  src/tools/Makefile, src/tools/periph/Makefile:
	  Use dependencies for commands and tools; using intermediate .o
	  files was the easiest (and GCC-version-independent) way to do
	  this. Fixes #1415598 (build deps for commands are missing).

2006-03-04  Stas

	* [r1561] src/base/misc/utilities.c:

2006-03-04  Bart

	* [r1559] src/env/video/render.c:
	  Dirty everything in vgaemu re-inits. Fixes #1407567 (vgaemu
	  problem with stdemo).

2006-03-03  Bart

	* [r1558] (all directories)
	  Set ignore properties on directories.

	* [r1557] src/base/serial/ser_init.c, src/dosext/misc/xms.c:
	  Replace $Header$ by $ Id: $ (svn only understands $ Id: $)

	  src/commands/xmode.c:
	  Set svn:eol-style to CRLF for all DOS text files.

2006-02-28  Bart

	* [r1555] src/include/vm86plus.h:
	  Don't set force_return_for_pic. I'll leave it in the macro like
	  this for now, so if we really find a testcase we can re-enable
	  it.

	* [r1554] src/arch/linux/async/signal.c, src/base/dev/pic/pic.c,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	  More correct handling of VIP; only have it set when VIF is not
	  set, and and a hardware interrupt is requested. Optimize DPMI so
	  that it does not return to dosemu code when interrupts are
	  pending but VIF is not set.

	* [r1553] src/include/cpu.h:
	  Change pointer casts to use unions (to allow -O2 without
	  -fno-strict-aliasing). This does not allow removal of
	  -fno-strict-aliasing but is a step in that direction.

2006-02-27  Stas

	* [r1552] src/dosext/dpmi/vxd.c, src/dosext/dpmi/windefs.h:
	  Compile in the win32s support. It is still not activated, but at
	  least it is now clear what functions needs to be implemented (not
	  too much).

2006-02-27  Bart

	  src/plugin/gpm/mouse_gpm.c, src/plugin/kbd_unicode/keyb_raw.c,
	  src/plugin/term/mouse_xterm.c, src/plugin/term/term_core.c:
	  Replaced is_console(), check_console() and config.console by a
	  single on_console() function. Moved console config scrubbing to
	  config_post_process(). Made scr_state_init() static.

2006-02-26  Stas

	* [r1550] src/dosext/dpmi/msdos.c:

	  Fixes #1418023 duke3d and cursor at wrong location

	* [r1547] src/base/init/parser.y.in:
	  Move getpwuid() check to only do this when DOSEMU is executed
	  suid or sudo: there is no need to access /etc/passwd when running
	  non-suid.

	* [r1452] src/commands/ems.S:
	  Remove comment about himem.sys. It is a personal decision whether
	  people like to use himem.sys, himem.exe, fdxms.sys, fdxxms.sys or
	  the internal XMS driver, all of which have their advantages and
	  disadvantages.

	  can activate it if no other XMS driver is loaded. Merge old $_xms

	  Solves problem with ZIPKEY (reported by Ralph Alvy, linux-msdos)

	* [r1436] src/emu-i386/cputime.c:

2005-12-03  Bart

	* src/base/: dev/misc/pci.c, async/pci_bios.c:
	Explicitly clear 0 bits in CF8 dword writes. Revert PCI_EN handling to what

2005-12-03  Clarence

	* src/include/emu.h:
	* make config.features doc realistic
	* bump up number of features to 16 to avoid recompile of every

	add a different hack - Bart suggested in 2003 to use malloc()
	but I think that's overkill

	* src/base/init/config.c:

	Also, moved dos_read/write to dos2linux.c to make them globally
	available. And removed the __builtin_constant_p() check in LINEAR2UNIX -
	gcc might still be able to optimize the const addresses, but falling
	back for dosaddr_to_unixaddr() will happen less frequently.

	* src/: commands/ems.S, include/emm.h, dosext/misc/emm.c,
	  dosext/misc/emm.h:
	- Implemented the version checking for ems.sys. Whoever forgets
	to update one, will now get the deserved punishment.
	- Since the bug was in the UMB hook, not in the EMS driver, made
	ems.sys not to install the UMB hook too, if dosemu refused EMS.
	("EMS 4.0.1" was very funny :-)

	* src/commands/ems.S:
	Avoid using "lret $2" - this doesn't restore the IF flag, causing
	the program to lock up (noticed with iplay).
	Bumped up the version. Some version checking is really needed here.
	Important: bios.S have to be inspected for the like things.

	Added the standalone mode - midid can now launch timidity itself.
	Added the capture mode - midid can now capture and redirect the
	sound generated by timidity.
	Nothing of the above works with the current timidity, and so the
	usage description of the new params is disabled.
	Also changed the default timidity timeout to 0 (no timeout).

	Unmap conventional memory until just before boot; VESA ints temporarily
	map it when necessary.
	BIOS setup calls iodev_reset. Moved iodev_init after priv_drop() and priv.
	needing inits out of it. Add disk, printer, ipx, pktdrvr init/reset to

	Set all interrupts (incl. all video ints) in bios/setup.c
	Repair config.vbios_post=1 + VESA
	VESA pre-boot information gathering uses complete /dev/mem information.

	Moved R/W data in the BIOS to 0xd000, and use indirect jumps/calls instead

	Move the BIOS parts under 0xf4000 back beyond 0xfc000.
	Change default EMS page frame to 0xe4000 so that the new space is used

	* src/: base/async/int.c, emu-i386/do_vm86.c, include/int.h:
	Split off do_int_from_hlt() from do_int(). It simplifies some processing

	Use READ/WRITE_WORD for IOFF, ISEG, and SETIVEC.

	* src/: env/video/text.c, include/video.h:
	Moved ATTR and CHAR macros from video.h to text.c. They access internal
	vgaemu RAM, so no need for READ_BYTE etc.

	* src/base/bios/: int10.c, int17.c:
	Use macros to access BIOS variables in int10.c.
	int17.c does not need MUNPROT emulator stuff, because it's all read only.

	Use READ_DWORD etc. in int.c; small optimization; flag floppy timeout to
	controller (note that the floppy controller port 0x3f2 isn't emulated yet).

	Replace "int xx" in bios.S trampoline by hlt. Minimal change: further
	cleanups are possible.

2005-08-15  Clarence

	* dist/dosemu, src/base/init/config.c:
	Wrapper script: don't pass "dosemu.bin" as argv[0], pass the wrapper scr
	ipt name instead.

	config.c: Look for --version/--help arg anywhere in the argv[] list
	(so as to not complain on "xdosemu --help" which prepends a -X to argv[]).
	Don't print out "xdosemu = dosemu -X" if already using xdos/xdosemu.

2005-08-14  Stas

	* src/include/dosemu_debug.h:
	Bump up the gcc version needed for attribute format.

2005-08-14  Bart

	* src/dosext/mfs/: mangle.c, mangle.h:
	Use new min/max macros in mangle.c.

2005-08-13  Bart

	* src/emu-i386/simx86/interp.c:
	Correct case labels for 0xb0, 0xb1, should not be -1 (CMPXCHG).

2005-08-11  Stas

	* src/: dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, emu-i386/do_vm86.c:
	Remove the ancient pic_resched hacks.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Fixes on a failure path (cosmetic)

2005-08-06  Stas

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Initialize the DPMI FPU context to something sensible.
	Also poll the DMA more frequently.
	Be more carefull about the FPU context copying.
	Do FPU context initialization in indirect DPMI switch.

2005-08-05  Stas

	* src/: include/smalloc.h, include/utilities.h,
	  base/misc/smalloc.c:
	Use the compatibility FORMAT macro in a few places.

2005-08-05  Bart

	* src/: arch/linux/mapping/mapfile.c, include/smalloc.h:
	Compatibility with older gcc versions.

2005-08-03  Bart

	* src/env/video/instremu.c:
	Made instremu assembly macros compatible with earlier gcc versions.

2005-08-03  Stas

	* src/plugin/kbd_unicode/serv_backend.c:
	Got tired of the ocasional keypress duplications and increased
	the keyboard char delay to 800uS.
	Actually, the duplicate keypresses have not disappeared in BC IDE
	at all. Set the latency to 2000uS - now they seem to really have
	gone.

	* src/: emu-i386/cpu.c, dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, dosext/dpmi/dpmi.h,
	  dosext/dpmi/msdos.c, include/cpu.h, include/emu.h:
	Implemented FPU state switching. Needed for my new sound code
	and is a long-overdue anyway.

2005-07-29  Stas

	* src/doc/HOWTO/EMUfailure.sgml:
	Clarify a comment about x-com game.

2005-07-26  Bart

	* src/base/async/int.c:
	Use new min macro.

	* src/base/dev/dma/dma.c:
	Fix warnings.

	* src/: dosext/sound/sound.c, base/dev/dma/dma.c, include/dma.h,
	  include/sound.h:
	Use new min/max macros in sound code, adjust some types to match.

	* src/: include/utilities.h, plugin/X/X.c:
	Use the same type-safe min/max macros as the Linux kernel uses and use
	them in X.c.

2005-07-25  Bart

	* src/env/video/remap.c:
	Added basic 15->32 and 16->32 remapper functions. Based on a patch by
	Mike Nelson, SF #1244195

2005-07-24  Bart

	* src/base/init/parser.y.in:
	No need (and wrong) to free Path_cdrom[which].

	* src/: emu.c, emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c:
	Allow cpuemu when $_rdtsc=(off). It uses RDTSC nevertheless (so should
	check for 586), but now with the timer code just using gettimeofday().

	* src/: arch/linux/async/signal.c, emu-i386/cputime.c,
	  include/timers.h, base/init/init.c, dosext/dpmi/memory.c,
	  emu-i386/simx86/emu86.h, dosext/drivers/aspi.c:
	Replaced HZ by the more modern sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK).
	The sigalarm handler now updates the time system counter base, so our
	TSC timer is a hybrid just like the one in the Linux kernel. This avoids
	DOS time slow downs because of inactive idle cpu's etc. Correct backtracing
	in emu86.h.

2005-07-24  Stas

	* etc/dosemu.conf, etc/global.conf, src/base/async/int.c,
	  src/base/dev/misc/rtc.c, src/include/iodev.h:
	Applied (by popular demand) the new timemode patch from Andrew Brooks.
	This should have a positive effect of having the cmos values in
	sync with the time in any mode. And it introduces the "linux"
	time source.
	New option is added to dosemu.conf.

2005-07-23  Bart

	* Makefile.conf.in, compiletime-settings, configure, configure.ac,
	  src/emu.c, src/include/cpu.h, src/plugin/sdl/Makefile,
	  src/plugin/sdl/Makefile.conf.in, src/plugin/translate/Makefile:
	Add support for compilation on x86-64.

	* src/env/video/instremu.c:
	We must use "q" and not "r" in byte-operating asm instructions to avoid
	GCC telling us "Error: bad register name `%sil".

	* src/dosext/dpmi/: dpmi.c, dpmi.h:
	Moved ds, es, fs, and gs check selector code into a function.
	Allow 1, 2, and 3 as null selectors. They sometimes seem to occur on
	x86-64. Simplified ValidSelector(): in practice it only needs to check for
	the LDT bit.

	* src/base/mouse/mouse.c:
	We should only erase a text mouse cursor if it's native and drawn, not
	unconditionally if it's non-native.

	* src/arch/linux/async/signal.c:
	Removed unused variable kernel_sa.

	* src/emu-i386/simx86/codegen-arch.c:
	Actually enable the hack to get bgidemo (and doom) working.

	* src/include/cpu.h:
	Forgotten sys/vm86.h change.

	* src/: emu-i386/simx86/cpu-emu.c, emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c,
	  env/video/vgaemu.c:
	Make simx86 more functional with DPMI code (both native and emulated).
	Adjusted bogus ((int)_cr2 < 0) test. Signal handlers use the signal stack
	and perhaps queue, and restore eflags, fs and gs. Revert the meanings of
	config.cpuemu==2 and 3. The fault handler takes better care of VGAEMU.

2005-07-22  Bart

	* src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c, etc/dosemu.conf, etc/global.conf,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, src/base/init/lexer.l.in,
	  src/base/init/parser.y.in, src/include/cpu-emu.h:
	Introduced new $_cpu_emu option to set to either "off", "vm86" or "full".
	config.cpuemu==4 now means full emulation, 3 means vm86 only.
	Adjusted DPMI to reflect this. CPUEMU's fault handler temporarily leaves
	the vm86-only emulator after a page fault if DPMI is active.
	Disabled non-emulated boot and vbios for now.

	* src/: include/vm86plus.h, include/Asm/vm86.h, base/dev/pic/pic.c,
	  base/misc/ioctl.c, dosext/net/net/ipx.c, emu-i386/do_vm86.c,
	  emu.c:
	Include Asm/vm86.h. Removed #include <sys/vm86.h> because this file is not
	available on AMD64.

2005-07-22  Stas

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Zero out FS/GS upon raw mode switches (bug #1242171)
	Also zero out the "undefined" registers.

2005-07-22  Clarence

	* src/: base/init/config.c, include/emu.h:
	As posted to dosemu-devel put without the usage() change:

	Config documentation cleanup and a little bit of getopt() fixing.

	Complete list of changes (it's smaller than it looks):
	- Remove unused, probably out-of-sync "struct debug_flags d"
	- Pass the same string to the 2 getopt calls and in sync with reality
	  (sometimes we were missing ":" or options entirely)
	- We need "--help" in addition to "--version" (I finally found out that
	  "--version" was the correct way to bring up the help, rather than triggering
	  a syntax error with "-h" :))
	- Remove unused "sizes" variable, group together code for handling obsolete
	  options
	- Print the bad character (not '?') when user types in incorrect option
	- usage():
	  # Remove "[-ABckballtheseareeitherwrongoroutofdateanyway]" etc. from the
	    description
	  # Remove non-existent options, obsolete options
	  # Document secret until now options like -S (so Bart, your SDL secret is out
	:))
	  # In other words, document all the options we have and be consistent with
	    the getopt string
	  # Move "%s --version" lower since it doesn't accept options
	  # Indent "%s --version" and "xdosemu [options]" for consistency with primary
	    command

2005-07-21  Bart

	* src/base/misc/fatfs.c:
	Use e_dos_read() to load the FreeDOS kernel when cpuemu is active.
	Allows running dosemu without using vm86 at all, useful for x86-64.

	* src/emu-i386/simx86/: codegen-arch.c, cpu-emu.c, interp.c:
	The correct expression for the virtual flags in DPMI is
	get_vFLAGS(TheCPU.eflags)
	which gets the VIF from the vm86s structure.

	* src/emu-i386/simx86/: codegen-arch.c, interp.c, sigsegv.c:
	simx86: Corrected vga_read/write calls, and VGAEMU port list. Removed
	is_cli stuff, as a blacklist is not needed here. Set up a hack for
	genbufsize. Enough for bgidemo to work.

2005-07-21  Stas

	* src/base/: init/parser.y.in, serial/ser_init.c:
	Init sptr->dev to NULL as parser now does free() and crashes.
	Have to check on the other similar bugs.

2005-07-20  Bart

	* compiletime-settings, compiletime-settings.devel,
	  default-configure:
	Remove linkstatic in compiletime-settings.*. Re-enable cpuemu in .devel.

	* src/emu-i386/simx86/: codegen-arch.c, cpu-emu.c, interp.c:
	Replace dpmi_eflags with _EFLAGS in simx86. Not quite sure how correct this
	is. Copy the LDT table that dpmi_setup() put up into the simx86 LDT.
	With these changes simx86 works again for DPMI (not perfectly but...).

	* src/emu-i386/simx86/sigsegv.c:
	s/Logical_VGA/vga/

	* src/emu-i386/simx86/protmode.c:
	Fix a bug in simx86's LAR handling. This was *the* major bug in simx86.

2005-07-20  Clarence

	* src/: arch/linux/debugger/mhpdbgc.c, emu-i386/ports.c,
	  env/video/matrox.c:
	Many people don't know how to use fgets() and waste 1 byte :)
	Avoid using hardcoded constants without changing someone else's style too much.

2005-07-20  Bart

	* src/: env/video/vgaemu.c, env/video/video.c, base/bios/int10.c:
	Do the fake call to the int10 post/video set a bit later, and set a few
	more variables in vga_emu_init(). This gets the Bochs vgabios back to work.

2005-07-20  Stas

	* src/plugin/kbd_unicode/serv_backend.c:
	Emulate the bits 0 and 1 of the keyboard_flags_3 (0x40:0x96)
	(fixes #1230579)
	Respect the state of the keyboard_flags_3 instead of relying on
	the one remembered by dosemu (second part of #1230579)

2005-07-20  Bart

	* src/dosext/mfs/: lfn.c, mfs.c, mfs.h:
	LFN MFS fixes: basic volume label for LFN findfirst, give "access denied"
	when trying to remove a non empty dir. Fixes VC move problem, #1238148;
	and cleanups: header files, replace MAXPATHLEN with PATH_MAX.

2005-07-19  Bart

	* src/env/video/: crtcemu.c, vgaemu.c:
	Modify vga_emu_adj_config to adjust VESA modes that are within bounds,
	in general < 2048x1024x8bpp. Setup the CRT mode init that way as well.

	* src/env/video/seqemu.c:
	Set vga.seq.data[4] to the correct value for VESA modes.

2005-07-18  Bart

	* src/base/mouse/mouse.c:
	Let mouse_move_absolute only cause a callback to (e.g.) perhaps warp the
	X cursor if the mouse was clipped.

	* src/base/bios/int10.c:
	Unconditionally set the bios cursor shape variable, even if set to
	invisible. This fixes a problem with DN.

	* src/env/video/vga.c:
	Don't check for the int10 location if $_vbios_post=(1).

2005-07-17  Bart

	* src/env/video/: crtcemu.c, vgaemu.c:
	Adjust some crtc registers in 8bpp vesa modes, and recognize them in
	the adjust config routine. Perhaps that allows a windows vesa driver to
	work.

	* src/base/: mouse/mouse.c, mouse/mousevid.c, bios/bios.S:
	Fix missing 0x typo in mousevid.c; check if the vesa mode was really set.
	The mode is now passed on the stack instead of in cx.

	* src/env/video/: text.c, vgaemu.c:
	Set video to off initially so that the screen won't get updated before the
	initial mode set. Also don't divide by zero in check_cursor_location.
	Fixes #1239421

2005-07-17  Stas

	* src/plugin/X/X.c:
	Properly track FocusIn/FocusOut X events (further fixing #920216)

	* src/: include/mouse.h, base/mouse/mouse.c:
	Replace mouse.rx and mouse.ry with a macros to reduce the
	amount of the variables we should keep in sync.

	* src/base/mouse/mouse.c, src/plugin/X/X.c:
	Move mouse pointer no matter whether it is visible or not
	(part of #920216)
	Forgotten piece of the partial #920216 fix.

2005-07-16  Bart

	* src/: env/video/console.c, env/video/vgaemu.c, include/mouse.h,
	  base/bios/bios.S, base/mouse/gcursor.c, base/mouse/mouse.c,
	  base/mouse/mousevid.c, base/mouse/mousevid.h:
	fix #1206135 by passing bx from vesa mode sets to the mouse mode set
	adjustments. This works for vgaemu and all fixed console vesa modes.
	However, don't draw any mouse cursor: gcursor.c doesn't know about
	LFBs, >8 bpp and bank switching.

	* src/base/init/parser.y.in:
	Removed a free() that was a tad too aggressive.

2005-07-15  Bart

	* src/: base/init/parser.y.in,
	  plugin/translate/config/plugin_parser, base/dev/misc/joystick.c,
	  base/dev/misc/lpt.c, plugin/term/mouse_xterm.c:
	Plugged some memory leaks in the parser (thanks to valgrind). Simplify
	mouse_xterm detection (which was also a leak).

	* src/: base/misc/priv.c, base/misc/utilities.c,
	  arch/linux/async/debug.c, include/dosemu_config.h,
	  arch/linux/debugger/mhpdbgc.c, base/init/config.c:
	Reintroduced dosemu_proc_self_exe, as it comes in really handy for dosdebug.
	Fall back to dosemu_argv[0] for older valgrinds and qemu if it's NULL.
	Plugged a small memory leak.

	* src/arch/linux/async/signal.c:
	Use RTLD_NEXT to find glibc's default (non-pthread) sigaction. Saves a
	bit of effort on our part. This technique is borrowed from Wine: if they
	can do it, we can do it too.

	* src/: env/video/vesa.c, base/bios/int10.c, env/video/console.c,
	  env/video/hgc.c, env/video/vgaemu.c, env/video/video.c,
	  include/video.h:
	Moved BIOS variable init from video.c to int10.c
	Install a small real VGA BIOS for all vgaemu clients, that just contains
	the static functionality table, no fonts.

2005-07-15  Stas

	* src/: arch/linux/async/debug.c, arch/linux/debugger/mhpdbgc.c,
	  base/init/config.c, include/dosemu_config.h, base/misc/priv.c,
	  base/misc/utilities.c:
	Remove dosemu_proc_self_exe. It doesn't work under qemu and
	valgrind, it can have problems with privs, and overall it
	looks useless.

2005-07-14  Bart

	* src/: base/misc/utilities.c, emu-i386/cpu.c, emu-i386/ports.c:
	Use fscanf directly instead of fgets and then sscanf. Avoids some
	arbitrarily sized buffers.

2005-07-13  Bart

	* src/base/bios/int10.c:
	Moved adjust_font_size into a function of its own instead of fiddling with
	the high word of mode in set_video_mode. Implement changing scanlines after
	mode sets so that "mode co80,43" really gives you 43 lines in xdosemu.

2005-07-13  Stas

	* etc/dosemu.conf, src/arch/linux/mapping/mapfile.c,
	  src/arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c,
	  src/arch/linux/mapping/mapshm.c, src/include/mapping.h:
	- Fixed $_mapping="mapfile" by providing the separate ops for
	"mapfile" and "mapshm", otherwise one can't select.
	- Added "mapashm" option for the anon-shm mapping.
	- "mapshm" is now a default.

	* src/base/misc/smalloc.c:
	Don't call any smalloc functions on error path, as they may assert.

	* src/base/init/parser.y.in:
	cosmetic

2005-07-12  Stas

	* etc/dosemu.conf:
	typo.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/: dpmi.c, msdos.c:
	Small fixes.

2005-07-12  Bart

	* src/: base/mouse/mouse.c, include/mouse.h, plugin/X/X.c:
	Made some mouse functions static, removed some unused mouse code.
	Re-enabled Mouse->set_cursor call in mouse_do_cur to be able to warp the
	X cursor. However, be more conservative and safer in warping than before:
	- don't warp if snap_X is active or if the mouse cursor is off.
	- ignore any events caused by pointer warps; they often triggered infinite
	  actions because the event could be different from what we warped to.
	In non grab mode this fixes some issues with SC2000 (dual mouse cursor),
	and VPA (vga planets assistant, clicking didn't move the cursor).

	* src/: base/bios/int10.c, include/memory.h:
	Program display start via crtc for mode sets in terminal mode; fix TEXT_SIZE
	This fixes some new issues with programs that use multiple pages in terminal
	mode.

	* src/: base/init/dev_list.c, plugin/term/mouse_xterm.c:
	Initialize video before mouse and don't use the native (text) cursor
	for the xterm mouse.

2005-07-11  Bart

	* src/plugin/: X/X.c, sdl/sdl.c:
	Revert X and SDL to use video_mode global variable for now. Necessary for
	VESA modes, in particular with z80s (spectrum emulator).

	* src/plugin/X/X.c:
	Correct MIT-SHM X error handling. It didn't work over remote X via ssh.
	Call leavedos from the X error handler, otherwise it leaves DOSEMU
	uncleanly.

	* src/base/bios/int10.c:
	We can't change the number of screen rows in terminal mode when adjusting
	the font size.

2005-07-10  Bart

	* src/: dosext/dpmi/msdos.c, env/video/instremu.c,
	  include/vgaemu.h:
	From Stas: implements decode_modify_segreg_insn (instruction decoder
	for modified segment registers in msdos.c) in instremu.

	* src/: base/bios/int10.c, env/video/video.c, include/video.h:
	Eliminated video_subsys, *height and text_scanlines global variables.
	set_cursor_shape now takes care of setting the BIOS variable as well.
	Cleaned up int10/ah=f to work like a real video bios does.

	* src/: emu.c, base/bios/bios.S, base/init/dev_list.c,
	  base/init/init.c, env/video/vesa.c, env/video/vga.c,
	  env/video/video.c, include/video.h, plugin/X/X.c,
	  plugin/sdl/sdl.c:
	Moved video priv_init/init/close to iodev list; the init no longer needs to
	map any /dev/mem, it all comes from the register_hardware_ram list.
	Always boot via setting a video mode, or POSTing, not just on the console;
	use 0:449 for the mode. Remove most other mode setters.
	Use fake_call_to() where possible.
	Merged init_vga_card() with vga_post_init().
	Eliminated font_height global variable.

	* src/base/init/config.c, src/include/emu.h, src/plugin/translate/translate.c,
	  etc/global.conf, src/base/init/config.c,
	  src/base/init/lexer.l.in, src/base/init/parser.y.in,

	* src/plugin/commands/unix.c:
	Even a better heuristic can be done if we check for '/' to be

	* src/plugin/commands/unix.c:
	Use strchr() for '/' to destinguish the dos/linux path.
	Not convinced that it is a bad solution, and it is better
	than now in any case.

2005-07-09  Stas

	* src/arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c:
	realloc() from NULL should malloc(), and also added some

	but I'd like too see them.

	* src/dosext/misc/emm.c:
	Don't pass zero-sized EMS allocations to the memory management
	subsystems. smalloc is really against the zero-sized allocations
	(deliberate decision, won't change), but the EMS specs explicitly
	allows the zero-sized allocations :(
	Fixes the problems with Windows 3.0

2005-07-08  Clarence

	* src/: base/dev/misc/joystick.c, emu-i386/ports.c:

	Rearrange joystick global init order to match def order somewhat.
	Initialise joy_port_[xy] to -1 so that if the port handlers are ever reinstated
	for when there is no joystick and the first joystick port access is an inb,
	the axis bits will be set high like the buttons (the byte returned will be 0xFF).

	Update comments to emphasise Stas' r1.4 change (don't register joy port handlers
	if no joy).

	* etc/dosemu.conf:

	* src/: emu-i386/ports.c, env/video/video.c:
	Replace ioperm by set_ioperm in ports.c; otherwise almost all ports are

	Also disable the native speaker when not on the console or you'd get all

	  env/video/dualmon.c, env/video/vgaemu.c, include/memory.h,
	  include/vgaemu.h, include/video.h:
	Get rid of SCREEN_ADR(), use screen_adr() instead, which uses only BIOS
	variables. Use vga_write*, vga_read*, etc. functions to access VGA memory,

	  env/video/vc.c, env/video/vga.c, include/vc.h:
	Make set_vc_screen_page emulated-hardware instead of BIOS dependent.

	* src/: base/bios/int10.c, env/video/vgaemu.c, env/video/video.c,
	  include/video.h:
	Started merging set_video_mode() and X_set_video_mode()
	clear_screen() now clears the whole screen (all pages)
	video.c calls set_video_mode(video_mode) instead of clear_screen; this
	obsoletes a similar call in vgaemu.c.
	bios_scroll now takes the BIOS screen offset into account.

	  emu-i386/ports.c, env/video/dualmon.c, env/video/hgc.c,

	Eliminated hgc.h, made functions in hgc.c static, and some dualmon fixes.

	* dist/dosemu:
	"dosemu -install" fixes:
	1. Allow spaces in private dosemu directory name
	2. actually create a correct "~/.dosemu/drives/c" symlink (needs to be an absolute path)

	Bart, the patch is by no means comprehensive - you should audit the entire file for space
	problems e.g. suppose $HOME had a space in it.

	* src/: base/async/dyndeb.c, plugin/X/X.c:
	Unbreak -DX when not invoking executable as "xdos"
	"Unknown debug-msg mask: X"

	It is bogus putting register_debug_class later than config_init()
	as usage() won't show -DX - we're not going to reuse letters anyway
	(we have lots of spare letters and it would be confusing otherwise).

	I would say the same about "./src/plugin/translate/translate.c:    
	register_debug_class('u', 0, "Unicode translation");"
	but unfortunately but it's called earlier than even dyndeb.c:init()
	so not sure if safe to move into there as well.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/: dmemory.h, dpmi.c, dpmi.h, memory.c, msdos.c:
	Hopefully the last "huge cleanups" part.
	- Completed the msdos.c separation by not accessing any of the
	dpmi.c variables directly, use the DPMI API instead.
	- And there seem to be the off-by-one bugs that the segment
	limits were used as a length without +1, fixed.
	- Cleaned up the memory.c API again.
	With this state of affairs I was able to resync my DJGPP port
	of msdos.c rather quickly, so I think the code is now "clean enough".

2005-06-30  Stas

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Cleaned up the hack a little.

	* src/: base/async/int.c, dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, include/int.h:
	First pass on introducing the Windows Hack (tm) that will allow
	to run the DPMI apps in a Windows Standard mode DOS prompt (hence
	eliminating the need for the DOS prompt support in an Enhanced mode).
	Now running the DPMI in DOS prompt apps is possible, but an attempt
	to switch back to Windows before the DPMI app terminates, will crash.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/: dmemory.h, dpmi.c, dpmi.h, memory.c, msdos.c,
	  msdos.h:
	Next round of the "huge cleanups":
	- Separated memory.c from dpmi.c by passing the root of the memory
	list as a parameter to all the memory.c functions.
	- The DPMI state structure can now be static.
	- Made msdos.c to not use memory.c directly - it now tracks the
	memory allocations itself, as it should under real DOS (backported
	the appropreate code from my DJGPP playground). This is not very
	effective under dosemu, but this is the only possible way under
	real DOS, and is also now unavoidable because msdos.c doesn't any
	longer have the root of the memory list to pass to the memory.c API.
	- Unfortunately the memory.h name is already taken, so the added
	header is called dmemory.h :(

	  dosext/dpmi/msdos.c, dosext/dpmi/msdos.h, base/bios/bios.S,
	  include/bios.h:
	Next step in separating dpmi.c/msdos.c. dpmi.c no longer accesses
	the state struct of the API translator, but it now calls its
	hooks directly, while normally the translator should register
	that hooks via the DPMI API. This will, however, add an extra
	context switches under dosemu, so the current state is probably
	the most adequate for dosemu. A few extra hooks should not be
	a big problem for the DJGPP port either.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/: dpmi.c, dpmi.h, memory.c, vxd.c:
	- Remove the pre-client DPMI_SEL selector. It doesn't need to be
	per-client, we only have to be care to provide the 16bit and 32bit
	version of it separately. This way vxd.c no longer accesses the
	DPMI state structure directly.
	- Moved dpmi_setup() from memory.c to dpmi.c and make it to
	allocate the above two selectors.
	- Made LDT_ALIAS and PMSTACK_SEL really per-client this time
	(the old code that inherits them was forgotten to remove).

	Some large cleanups:
	- First step at separating the API translator from DPMI. msdos.c
	now has its own state structure, all the translator-related stuff
	moved there from the DPMI structure. msdos.c no longer accesses
	the DPMI structure, but the dpmi.c still accesses the translator
	structure - this can't be addressed without a big functionality
	changes.

	Fix a related potential SIGSEGV in the parser.

	Install a hook function for LFNs via f000:0210 using the new split

	* src/base/async/int.c:
	Split the interrupt_function array into two sets, one for revectored
	ints and one for non-revectored ints. This allows using a real DOS mouse
	driver without flipping function pointers, and also repairs
	$_mouse_dev="com1".

	* src/: dosext/dpmi/msdos.c, env/video/instremu.c:
	Use instremu to decode certain segment modifying instructions in msdos.c

	(lacks one small fix in svgalib), but mention the fact that dosemu
	can be started from under the fbcon.

	* NEWS:
	Some more news added. But do not mention tasmx since it was just a
	regression at some point after all (2005-02-24 namely)

	* configure.ac:
	Cosmetic about the svgalib detection.

2005-05-19  Bart

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, VERSION:
	NEWS and ChangeLog updates for 1.3.2.

2005-05-10  Bart

	* src/dosext/misc/xms.c:
	Fix the XMS_RET() macro; and making it a function is more efficient.
	Added some comments to hopefully make sure the same bugs don't creep in
	again. This fixes Aladdin's issues with XMS.

2005-05-09  Bart

	* src/base/misc/fatfs.c:
	Don't scan files on fatfs drives for FreeDOS, as this DOS has these
	drives redirected early enough for int13 never to be necessary.
	This can save quite a bit of startup time.

	* src/: base/async/int.c, dosext/mfs/mfs.c, include/redirect.h:
	If the CDS changes, try to redirect any fatfs drives that did not fit in
	the CDS before. This may happen when FreeDOS changes LASTDRIVE from
	config.sys, and more than 4 fatfs drives are defined.

2005-05-08  Bart

	* etc/dosemu.alias, etc/vga10x24.bdf, etc/vga12x30.bdf,
	  etc/vga8x19.bdf, src/arch/linux/Makefile.main:
	Added some more vga fonts, which more or less match 640x480, 800x600
	and 1024x768 resolutions. Thanks to Martin Reuber, OFD Kiel,
	German Fiscal Administration

2005-05-06  Stas

	* src/env/video/: vga.c, vbe.c:
	- Make do_int10_setmode() to do something more than just locking up
	the video bios.
	- Disabled the "special memory mode" - Matrox G550 doesn't honour
	the bit15 (even for that mode!), so the memory was cleared before
	saving. By the way, Matrox can handle our banked saving/restoring
	very well, but Radeon 7500 miserably fails on our bankswitching code.
	- Disabled the "set mode before restore" hack - that never worked
	because of the both the above bugs, it only makes problems.
	- Restoring the ext regs is necessary after saving/restoring the video
	memory (well, without using the "special memory mode" it may not be
	necessary, but I added it to stay safe).

	This makes the console VESA driver pretty much usable.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/msdos.c:
	Really fix int21h/ah=38h this time! tasmx is now finally... yuck

2005-05-05  Stas

	* etc/dosemu.conf, src/include/emu.h, src/include/vc.h,
	  src/env/video/avance.c, src/env/video/cirrus.c,
	  src/env/video/matrox.c, src/env/video/s3.c, src/env/video/sis.c,
	  src/env/video/vbe.c, src/env/video/vga.c:
	Fixed some bugs with $_vmemsize, made it to accept (auto) and (off),
	defaulted to 4096 to make the console switching faster.

2005-05-05  Stas

	* src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/midid/: device.c, device.h, timid.c:
	Cosmetics and gcc-4 warning fixes.

2005-05-04  Stas

	* src/env/video/: svgalib.c, vbe.c:
	Cosmetic.

	* src/: include/debug.h, emu.c:
	Make the gdb stacktracer interface globally available.

	* src/emu-i386/do_vm86.c:
	This sanity check made problems.

2005-05-02  Stas

	* src/env/video/X.c:
	$_X_fixed_aspect can work for the text modes too.

2005-05-02  Bart

	* src/plugin/sdl/include/sdl_config.h.in:
	Added forgotten file sdl_config.h.in

2005-05-01  Bart

	* configure, configure.ac:
	Re-fix auto setting for target-cpu.
	Use -Wno-pointer-sign for gcc-4.0 to avoid obscuring really useful warnings
	for now.

	* src/plugin/sdl/Makefile:
	Fix makefile in previous commit.

	* src/plugin/sdl/: Makefile, configure, configure.ac,
	  config/plugin_config.h, config/plugin_config.h.in:
	Use include/sdl_config.h[.in] included in config/plugin_config.h just like the
	kbd_unicode plugin does. This avoids the "mkpluginhooks-before-configure"
	problem.

	* configure, configure.ac, default-configure:
	#1118031: --target_cpu should be --with-target-cpu or it doesn't work.

	* src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c:
	Let MFS "commit" return TRUE if fsync was successful (it was reversed).
	Happens to fix the problem with Word's "disk is full" message.

2005-05-01  Stas

	* etc/dosemu.conf, src/base/serial/ser_init.c:
	tty locking can be disabled by $_ttylocks=""

2005-05-01  Bart

	* etc/global.conf, src/plugin/kbd_unicode/config/plugin_parser:
	Fix #1110543 Custom keyboard layout
	The underlying foreach parser problem is still a mystery, but as long the
	keytables work...

	* compiletime-settings, compiletime-settings.devel,
	  compiletime-settings.help, configure, configure.ac,
	  default-configure, src/arch/linux/async/signal.c,
	  src/base/mouse/mouse.c, src/env/video/console.c,

	  src/include/config.h.in, src/include/video.h,
	  src/plugin/kbd_unicode/dosemu_keys.c,
	  src/plugin/kbd_unicode/keyb_clients.c,
	  src/plugin/term/terminal.c:
	Remove the S-Lang plugin. DOSEMU now cooperates nicely with all SLang
	libraries that are present in Linux distributions, so it is no longer
	necessary. Made a comment about some minor issues with the various
	library versions in existence.
	If no slang-devel library is installed, DOSEMU can now compile without
	terminal support.

	* doc/README.gdb:
	correct typo

	* src/: plugin/term/Makefile, plugin/term/mouse_gpm.c,
	  base/mouse/Makefile, base/mouse/mouse_gpm.c:
	Move mouse_gpm.c from src/plugin/term to src/base/mouse.

	* configure, src/include/config.h.in:
	Regenerate autoconf files.

2005-04-29  Stas

	* src/dosext/dpmi/msdos.c:
	Further fixes for translation of int21h/ah=38h and 5dh

	* src/base/mouse/mousevid.c:
	for text modes too.

	* src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c:
	Debug msg.

	* src/: base/bios/int10.c, base/mouse/mousevid.c,
	  env/video/vgaemu.c, include/vgaemu.h:
	- Fixed 40h:4eh bios value (current video page start)
	- Made the gfx-cursor code to take that value into an account
	(works in Orbits3 properly now)
	- Disabled the X-specific code for gfx-cursor. This can introduce
	the regressions, but as the gfx-cursor for X was added just a few
	days ago (what was that X-specific code then, if there wasn't a
	gfx-cursor under X before?), the regressions on it are not a problem.

	* src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c:
	Off-by-one error in MFS code causes lock-ups (bug #1189666)

2005-04-27  Stas

	* src/dosext/dpmi/msdos.c:
	Fixed int21h/ah=38h translation to get tasmx to work. Yes, tasmx
	used to work sometime in the past, but the bug was always there,
	so it couldn't work properly.
	Also fixed 2 gcc4 warnings.

2005-04-26  Stas

	* src/env/video/X.c:
	Fullscreen mode can now always enable mouse grab.

	* src/base/: init/lexer.l.in, init/parser.y.in, misc/disks.c:
	Applied patch #845119 - 2.8M floppy support.
	The patch was there for 1.5year already - enough!

	* src/: env/video/instremu.c, env/video/vgaemu.c, include/vgaemu.h:
	Moved instremu to the new vga helpers, Logical_VGA_xxx can now be static.

	* src/: include/vgaemu.h, base/mouse/gcursor.c, base/mouse/mouse.c,
	  env/video/vgaemu.c:
	- Added the vga memory access helpers
	- Moved gfx-cursor code to use that helpers
	- Enabled the gfx mouse cursor code under X

	GFX mouse cursor now works under X!

2005-04-24  Stas

	* src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/linux_sound.c:
	Fix recent small regression with sound code (kryptegg works again)

	* src/env/video/vc.c:
	Remove unused (and crap) DUMP_VIDEO

	* src/base/mouse/: gcursor.c, mouse.c:
	Another small step towards the gfx mouse cursor under X.

	* src/env/video/svgalib.c:
	Trying to resurrect the svgalib support.
	It really works much faster than our VESA driver (due to the
	use of the native driver) but it doesn't save the video memory,
	so there may be some problems.

	* configure.ac:
	Added proper svgalib checks. New svgalibs are better, but we can't
	even link the old ones in.
	But not enable it for now - svgalib still misses one very small
	patch that I forgot to submit, and so it crashes, damn. Will have
	to wait for the next version again :(((

	* src/include/vc.h:
	Increase MAX_X_REGS as per the new svgalib.

	* src/env/video/: vc.c, vga.c:
	Disable dump_video(). It can crash if the MAX_X_REGS of dosemu
	mismatches with MAX_REGS of svgalib.

2005-04-20  Stas

	* src/emu-i386/ports.c:
	set_ioperm() should also set the std-handler. This allows the dosemu
	code to call port_outb/port_inb even for the iopermed ports, and the
	real I/O will occur. This is necessary for the mouse gfx code to work
	under X.
	Also disabled HANDLE_VID_IO and HANDLE_SPECIAL. They prevented the
	above code from working and also these features looks completely
	broken and useless.

2005-04-19  Stas

	* src/base/init/: config.c, parser.y.in:
	Repair $_rdtsc

2005-04-17  Stas

	* src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/midid/timid.c:
	Increase timidity timeout from 1 to 3 seconds - timidity is slow
	these days.

	* etc/dosemu.conf, etc/global.conf, src/include/emu.h,
	  src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/linux_sound.c,
	  src/arch/linux/dosext/sound/linux_sound.h,
	  src/base/init/config.c, src/base/init/lexer.l.in,
	  src/base/init/parser.y.in:
	Added the option to control the direct DAC write frequency for OSS.
	No longer need to hack linux_sound.h

	* src/: base/mouse/mouse.c, include/memory.h:
	Moved Mouse_INT_OFF to memory.h and adjusted it instead of changing
	the segment (Stas wake up and stop stumbling around the mouse code!)

	* src/base/mouse/mouse.c:
	Mouse_INT now requires BIOSSEG.

	* src/: env/video/X.c, base/mouse/mouse.c, base/mouse/mouseint.c,
	  plugin/sdl/mouse_SDL.c:
	Enable the native mouse cursor by default (to stay compatible), and
	the X and SDL frontends disable it manually.
	Also "raw" mouse needed the *2 for Y coordinate too. I don't know
	why, maybe the screen resolution is not taken into an account somewhere.

2005-04-16  Stas

	* src/: base/mouse/mouse.c, include/mouse.h:
	Move "native_cursor" to config.mouse, where it actually should be.

	* src/: env/video/X.c, plugin/sdl/mouse_SDL.c:
	X and SDL frontends were erroneously overriding the mouse sensitivity
	values. Also teached X.c about the 2:1 resolution. Native mouse cursor
	now have the proper speed.

	* src/base/mouse/mouse.c:
	Native cursor state should survive save/restore.

	* src/include/memory.h:
	Set 0x33 ivec (mouse) not to 0xf000 segment, as some programs (td)
	are refusing to use it in that case, and the offset should not be 0 too.
	(bug #818094 of myself)

2005-04-15  Stas

	* src/: env/video/X.c, base/mouse/mouse.c, include/mouse.h:
	Enable the native cursor code. Used under X only for now (not for SDL,
	for example). (RFE #1079033 of my own)

	* src/env/video/X.c:
	Disable the selection ability when mouse grab is enabled.

2005-04-14  Stas

	* src/env/video/: X.c, render.c, vbe.c, vga.c:
	Abort dosemu on the fatal video errors instead of having the blank screen.

2005-04-12  Stas

	* src/env/video/X.c:
	Added keyboard grab - hardcoded to Ctrl-Alt-k for now.

	* src/env/video/X.c:
	Remove some ancient code.

2005-04-09  Stas

	* src/: emu-i386/ports.c, base/dev/misc/joystick.c,
	  base/init/parser.y.in:
	Dont try to register the joystick if it is disabled/unavail. (SR #1178900)

2005-04-05  Stas

	* src/env/video/: crtcemu.c, seqemu.c:
	Previous patch needed this too.

	* src/env/video/: crtcemu.c, seqemu.c:
	Kill the optimization that optimizes nothing.

2005-04-04  Stas

	* src/env/video/X.c:
	Handle the unlikely case of the miltiple KeyRelease events.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	This keyboard hack is no longer needed.

	* src/env/video/X.c:
	Filter out the fake X KeyRelease events of the autorepeat keyboard mode.
	This fixes bug #1113468, all the recent keyboard regressions, and the
	number of the old keyboard bugs too.
	There are lots of hacks all around dosemu that were trying to work
	around that problem with the different level of success. They all now
	have to be located and removed.

2005-04-01  Stas

	* etc/global.conf:
	Set $BEING_ON for X too.

2005-03-28  Stas

	* src/plugin/commands/commands.c:
	generic.com should print something usefull too.

2005-03-27  Stas

	* src/plugin/commands/unix.c:
	Nah, use-after-free on error path.

2005-03-26  Stas

	* src/plugin/commands/unix.c:
	Fixes to unix builtin:
	- Dont strip the trailing slashes for the DOS directory path, as this
	path may consist of only that slash (second part of #1152829)
	- Dont terminate if the linux path we wanted to execute, doesn't exist.
	For the DOS path, figuring out the existance is more difficult, so left
	as is for now.

	* src/plugin/commands/builtins.c:
	Small cleanup.

	* src/emu-i386/: cpu.c, ports.c:
	Enlarge line buffer for proc scans, remove smiley ":)" from asm
	constraints (lets put smiles in a comments, not in the code:)

	* src/base/serial/ser_ports.c:
	Update the MSR status before reading it - should make the serial more
	robust.

	* src/base/dev/misc/rtc.c:
	Properly initialize date in cmos. "bios" timesource should now be
	quite usable.

	* src/base/dev/misc/rtc.c:
	Multiple bugs with date in RTC.

2005-03-22  Stas

	* src/include/dos2linux.h, src/base/misc/dos2linux.c,
	  src/plugin/commands/unix.c, src/base/misc/utilities.c,
	  etc/dosemu.conf:
	Fixed (and re-enabled) the terminate-after-execute feature (bug #1152829).
	Also some minor adjustments/leftovers.

2005-03-21  Stas

	* src/base/misc/utilities.c:
	/proc/self/maps can contain lines longer than 100 chars, causing DPMI
	to fail (old bug btw).

	* etc/dosemu.conf:
	0x40000000 for the $_dpmi_base was a bad choise for the non-flexmmap
	kernels. 0x10000000 looks safer.

2005-03-20  Stas

	* src/base/async/int.c:
	Calling io_select() is too expensive, dont do it more than 1000 times
	per second (a cheap fix for the keen4 lockups, but it is still too slow).

	* src/base/mouse/mouse.c:
	This improves the mouse responsiveness a lot.

	* src/base/mouse/mouse.c:
	Repair the mouse too.

	* src/: arch/linux/dosext/sound/linux_sound.c,
	  arch/linux/dosext/sound/linux_sound.h, dosext/sound/sound.c,
	  include/sound.h:
	This should make the sound recording to work properly (bug #1074310,
	was not confirmed)

	* src/doc/HOWTO/EMUfailure.sgml:
	This was fixed.

	* etc/dosemu.conf:
	Set $_X_aspect_43 to (off), as we agreed, AFAIR.
	This fixes z80s emulator visual artifacts, and many games too.

	* src/base/dev/pic/pic.c:
	Remove the PIC recursion.
	This will probably break everything again, but at least the keyboard
	should survive.

	* src/plugin/kbd_unicode/serv_backend.c:
	Preparing (again) the keyboard code for the removal of the PIC
	recursion. We have to simulate the proper delay between the chars,
	otherwise the nasties races are happening, and whatever is typed,
	gets doubled (bug #1037915).
	Set the emulated kbd clock frequency to 27.5KHz (that is, actually,
	after the set2->set1 translation of 8042; the real frequency may
	be slightly different).
	I hope this is the last implicit dependancy the keyboard code had
	to the PIC code. If all the other subsystems have so many too, then
	we'll be in a big troubles:)

	  src/include/utilities.h:
	Introduce the $_dpmi_base option which allows to choose the address
	of a DPMI memory pool. The problem with the dynamic allocation is
	that some programs can't handle the bit 31 in the pointers, and that's
	what being set now in the recent 2.6 kernels.
	Fixes Mortal Kombat 2 and SerfCity game saving (bug #1164054)

2005-03-17  Stas

	* src/base/async/int.c:
	Returned the old mouse hack of mine instead of the (currently disabled
	anyway) Bart's one. This fixes the mouse for SerfCity game, makes the
	mouse pointer to be syncronized at startup again, and (hopefully)
	removes the possibility of a crash when the DOS sets int33 to some crap.
	This doesn't allow to call into an external mouse driver, but thats
	a useless feature anyway.

	* src/doc/HOWTO/EMUfailure.sgml:
	Updated to reflect the current state of affairs.

	More work on preparing the keyboard code for the PIC recursion removal.

	* src/base/dev/pic/pic.c:
	Remove the now harmfull sanity check from pic_request(). This should
	fix most of the breakages of the previous commit.

2005-03-06  Stas

	* src/plugin/commands/: Makefile, blaster.c, blaster.h, commands.c:

	Linking with svgalib can produce a broken build because the svgalib

	svgalib is probably dead...

2005-02-28  Bart

	* src/plugin/sdl/sdl.c:

	* src/base/async/int.c:
	Disable the mouse iret hack (again).
	It turned out that DOS initializes the IVT to not always point to irets.
	If PC-DOS is booted without DOS=HIGH, then for some reasons it sets
	int33 (and others) to some crap, then the crash.
	Besides, this code simply asks for being disabled: the recursion have
	to be addressed in do_int(), not here.

2005-02-11  Stas

	More flexible idle system. For now tuned similar to the current one,
	except for the printer and async I/O, which, when active, give more
	power to dosemu.
	Now we can easily tune the things as per 1.2.1 and better.
	Helper would be nice to allow the run-time adjustments, or perhaps
	we need a section in dosemu.conf dedicated to the idle stuff.

2005-02-06  Bart

	Remove RealModeContext and the surrounding stuff.
	I dont know why it was introduced. It is stated it helps some DJ200
	compiler (djgpp?), but it looks like the hack to work around some
	bugs that are not there any more. If someone know why this stuff
	was necessary, let me know.
	Bart, please see if djgpp feels well now without the hack.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Made it possible for the 16bit clients to safely access the 32bit API.
	This is not defined in a DPMI specs, so this is a small extension.
	No 16bit client is allowed to use 32bit API, but it is necessary
	for the djgpp-ported API translator to provide the service for 16bit
	clients.

	* src/: include/pci.h, base/dev/misc/pci.c, base/async/pci_bios.c:
	Made pciemu to do something more than just locking up the card
	by fixing the inb/inw.
	Also the header space is enlarged (still reading 64bytes only though).
	Now it works with some cards, but in most cases it still doesnt.
	The cards that reserve an extra PCI ports (like my Radeon) are
	fine, but the ones that dont, usually keep the extended registers
	in the config space, right after the config header. The emulation
	approach cannot fork for them...
	The last argument I've heard against just limiting the direct PCI
	access, was that it would be too slow. But pci_port_inb/pci_port_outb
	already do this!
	I think pciemu have to go away. It is useless, at least for its

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Preserve the high word of ESP across the hw interrupts and exceptions
	for 16bit DPMI clients.
	This fixes the 16bit clients that use the 32bit code with 32bit stack
	sometimes.
	If the 16bit client is interrupted while on 32bit code/stack, it gets
	switched to 16bit stack, where the high word of ESP is lost because of
	the CPU bug. We can save/restore it by hands.
	The 32bit clients that work on 16bit stack are still vulnirable.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Consolidate the stack switching into enter_lpms()/leave_lpms().

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Fixed a diabolical bug in do_LAR asm. It was not taking an argument!
	So it operated on whatever random value was in %ax. Sometimes it

	works (again) and I suppose many other progs do as well.
	This bug was here (presumably) since 1996, and noone noticed?!!!

	context is not possible for many reasons (vm86() can emit the signals
	itself, or DPMI may not yet set everything up for realmode code, etc).

	* src/include/bios.h, src/base/misc/disks.c:
	For floppies call disk_close() only when the floppy MOTOR_TIMEOUT expired.
	Otherwise call fsync(). This improves floppy performance, particularly when

	* src/plugin/commands/builtins.c:
	lowmem_alloc cannot call com_error in case of failure, since com_error
	will call lowmem_alloc again (via com_doswrite). This fails and causes
	infinite recursion.

2004-11-09  Bart

	* src/base/async/int.c:
	int33() now takes over the int33 vector if it points to an iret. This is still

	* src/env/video/text.c:
	Fix invisible mouse selection in colour text programs. This code is what
	the Linux console selection code also uses to invert on VGA displays.

	* src/base/async/int.c:
	Simplified int code a bit: moved some code from run_caller_func() to
	do_int() to avoid checking things twice, and have only one place
	where real_run_int() is called. The mouse workarounds aren't necessary
	anymore; ctrl-c still works.

	* src/base/async/int.c:
	If dosemu have no internal function for interrupt, just call the

	Increase instremu count to 10 for LDT writes - looks a bit faster.

	* src/: base/async/int.c, dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Revector interrupts 0x1c, 0x23 and 0x24 for DPMI.
	This allows windows to handle critical errors like missing diskette
	in drive.

	* src/base/async/int.c:
	Dont call post_boot() anywhere but from int21/ah=4b and even then
	ignore the first invocation.
	The reason is that DOS sets int33 vector (and probably some other)
	to iret on the very late stages of its startup. This hack makes
	mouse to work again.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	- Fix bug with LDT segment expanding (hint from Japheth)
	- This makes it possible to decrease the initial LDT limit to 0xfff

	* src/dosext/dpmi/msdos.c:
	- Increased MAX_DOS_PATH: int21/ax=7160 needs 261 bytes.
	- Added API translation for int21/ax=7160 (Japheth)

	Maybe there are some bugs, but we need the config switch to choose
	between int15 and int33 interfaces.

2004-11-04  Bart

	* src/arch/linux/async/signal.c:

	* src/: base/async/int.c, base/mouse/mouse.c, base/bios/bios.S,
	  include/memory.h, include/mouse.h:
	int33() now uses a callback into the mouse driver to make sure the
	hogthreshold is done after the call even for DOS mouse drivers.
	A DOS mouse driver can now redirect int33; in that case we use NOREVECT
	for mouse_int(). To combine this with the callback via the hog code (which
	is always revectored) some extra checks and function pointer adjustments
	have to be made.
	Removed the unused indirect function pointer for the mouse callback.
	Enabling the internal driver no longer always sets the int33 vector.
	Implemented a second mouse callback for the PS/2 mouse BIOS.
	All this combined gives a PS/2 mouse bios that actually works so a
	DOS mouse driver (such as CTMOUSE 1.9) can be loaded into xdosemu --
	although to have it usable one needs to grab the mouse.

	* src/doc/HOWTO/dosemu-HOWTO.sgml:
	Removed any version information about Windows 3.x and dosemu.
	This remark was merely a historical saying when the VGA emulator was
	good enough to run Windows 3.x, it doesn't really matter today.
	The 1.2.0 fixes were merely to get it back on track, nothing specific
	to xdosemu vs. console dosemu.

2004-11-02  Stas

	* src/doc/HOWTO/dosemu-HOWTO.sgml:
	Rip some FUD/crap about Windows support from HOWTO:
	- .386 doesnt mean 32bit. There is nearly no 32bit code in Win31.
	- dosemu can run Windows since 1.2.0, not 0.64.3 (or it was broken
	for ages, at least on 1.0.x it doesnt work).
	- Icons do not disappear from Windows desktop, and winos2 doesnt
	make progman.exe to use system.ini instead of progman.ini (who wrote
	that kind of crap?)
	- Some other Windows-related junk ripped.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Support for unmodified Win31 386 kernel (thanks Japheth!):
	- Dynamically growing LDT, initial limit set to 0x1fff. This
	supercedes the allocation hack I've done for 286 kernel (hack removed).
	- Check for eIP to not exceed the CS limit (CheckSelectors())
	- When Windows creates the invalid LDT entries, just free the
	entry (type 0). This causes LAR to fail, same as if it would be of
	a type 0x0f, which Windows uses. Bingo!

	And oh yeah, there are still no reasons to use the unmodified
	Win31, at least before the proper mouse event translation is
	implemented.

	  Some definitions could be removed because the terminfo is reliable
	  enough.
	* Added logic to translate esc-key into alt-key so many definitions could
	  be removed from the table.
	* Added some entries for shift/ctrl/alt arrow keys etc in xterm and friends
	* Add support for kf1--kf48 as used by recent xterms. Makes it possible

	- Added several tricks that Windows relies upon.
	- Static DPMI initialization is now done only once, in dpmi_memory_init().

	This allows unmodified Win3.1 to work, but only krnl286.exe so far.
	krnl386.exe is not yet.
	There are no advantages in running unmodified windows, compared to WinOS2,
	only the disadvantages, like that you cant use mouse under X (don't even

	This was tested and benchmarked by Reinhard - thanks!
	Benchmarks shows that it is not faster than the old code, but the

	The console keyboard auto detection now merges with the US def, instead

	Changed $_layout="auto" to no longer blindly trust the console keyboard
	when running under X. A function was borrowed from Wine which compares
	the X keymap with all keymaps that we have (including perhaps the console
	keymap) and choose the one that matches best (as there is no way to
	obtain scancodes from X; X terminals may not be PCs after all).
	Hopefully fixes bug #999831.

	* src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c:
	Don't use asprintf() in exists() as there may not be enough space
	(fullname can become longer in find_file as names are unmangled).
	This caused a very nasty SIGSEGV when trying to delete a mangled name.
	Change to cheaper allocation on the stack with NAME_MAX+1 bytes for
	the filename component.

	* src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c:
	Converted chmod error into a warning; also used for utime() now.
	It now causes DOSEMU to ignore the request (not return an error),
	but only if errno==EPERM (not e.g. EROFS), the directory is writable,
	and chmod would actually change the mode.

	* src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c:
	convert_compare() now checks if the name has a ~ or ? at position 5;
	otherwise we don't need to mangle.
	Simplified extract_filename(), and auspr(): they may assume valid filenames.
	Convert * to ? before searching, so we don't need to check '*' in the
	comparison routines anymore.

	* Makefile:
	Removed the automatic autoconf rule again; it appears to have more drawbacks

	For findfirst delay the filename compare and stat to findnext's.

	Also moved the . and .. in root dir check out of the loop in
	scan_dir.

	* src/dosext/mfs/: lfn.c, mangle.c, mangle.h, mfs.c, util.c:
	Reverted VFAT optimization. It's not reliable for say \`o (o with accent
	grave) where the uppercase equivalent does not exist in CP437. The kernel
	does not uppercase it but DOS and DOSEMU convert it to O. So searching
	for POT where the filename is p\`ot means the expensive way is necessary.
	Introduced a DOS uppercase table to be able to do this quickly, and
	let the LFN code use this. Simplify name_ufs_to_dos to no longer do any
	uppercasing as strupperDOS does this much more quickly. Some cleanups
	in scan_dir to make it more similar to what it was before.

	Fixed a regression in mangle.c with the unicode->dos table.
	Use the stack instead of malloc in name_convert.
	Only mangle all names in the directory if what we are looking for
	is a mangled name in the first place! Otherwise a simple strcasecmp
	is sufficient. That's another 12x faster for scan_dir(non_mangled_name).

	unix->dos filename translation. Gives a further 30% speed improvement
	of readdir searches.

	Allow virtual maps of the video memory at 0xa0000 if !config.console_video

	* src/: arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, base/init/config.c,

	  env/video/vgaemu.c, env/video/video.c, include/emu.h,
	  include/mapping.h, include/pci.h:
	Extend $_hardware_ram to allow maps over 1MB with a virtual base that
	DPMI can get. Implement a new set of hardware RAM functions (register,
	map, list, get) and make $_hardware_ram, VGA(PCI), DPMI, and VESA its
	users. A special type (0) is used for virtual mappings (used by VGAEMU);
	otherwise the memcheck character types are used.
	map_hardware_ram tries to map everything that was registered, including
	the low VGA display memory.

	* src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c:
	Speed up scan_dir by uppercasing the name to search for outside the loop
	and only comparing the mangled short name for SFN searches.
	LFN searches only compare the long name case insensitively.
	Use VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_SHORT on vfat partitions from non-LFN code to
	make sure that LFN's are invisible when they aren't needed.
	Plug memory leak and page fault if you lredir'ed a non-existent
	directory.

	* src/include/emu.h:
	Making config.hogthreshold (and ocasionally a couple of other vars)
	signed - needed for my upcoming hogthreshold updates (using the
	negative thresholds sometimes).

	* src/: arch/linux/async/signal.c, base/async/int.c:
	Moving io_select() from sigalrm to do_periodic_stuff() speeds up the
	packet driver twice.

	* src/env/video/X.c:
	Set the real resolution for fullscrean, not the scaled one.

	  src/env/video/vga.h, src/include/emu.h, src/include/vc.h,
	  src/include/video.h:
	Add a VESA VBE graphics driver and make that the default. This driver
	should work with any VBE version; an LFB is not necessary
	LFB availability is only possible on PCI boards right now.
	If (say) your PCI VGA BIOS only supports VESA 1.2 then it should even be
	possible to load a TSR such as UNIVBE in DOSEMU and the driver will use
	that.

	Provide a way to force reentry into handle_signals() so that we don't
	miss too many SIGALRMs whilst saving the video memory (a thread would
	perhaps be a nicer solution).

2004-10-12  Stas

	* src/dosext/net/net/pktnew.c:
	Complain if the pkt driver is not able to handle the bandwidth.
	I was not able to trigger that, so I need to know it some queueing
	should be implemented or not.

	* src/include/pic.h:
	Allow PIC to process EOI from pkt and mouse. They no longer need any
	special treatment.

	* src/dosext/net/net/pktnew.c:
	With bound socket we dont need that hack any more.

	* src/env/video/X.c:
	Restore dotclock rate on switching from fullscreen to windowed mode,
	otherwise the very bad things happen.

	  emu-i386/ports.c, env/video/vga.c, include/bios.h,
	  include/port.h:
	Call int10/ax=mode for PLAINVGA before restoring registers. This helps
	when the BIOS is buggy or we don't restore enough registers ourselves;
	otherwise it doesn't hurt. The BIOS needs a check not to mess with
	the mouse driver.
	From Stas: introduce in_crit_section to make sure that the BIOS survives
	the callback. Allow callbacks when "frozen". Some small cleanups.

2004-10-11  Stas

	* src/dosext/net/net/: libpacket.c, libpacket.h, pktnew.c:
	Packet driver networking updates:
	- Use PF_PACKET/SOCK_RAW sockets instead of the deprecated and buggy
	AF_INET/SOCK_PACKET ones, changed the interfaces accordingly.
	- Put the sockets in a bind state - this allows to use the Async IO,
	which makes the direct NIC access mode ~50x faster.
	- Use simple read/write for IO - this is possible with the binded
	RAW sockets (not with the PACKET sockets though - they insist on
	sendto() even when binded, which is a bug).
	- Some large cleanups.

	* etc/dosemu.conf, src/dosext/net/net/libpacket.c,
	  src/dosext/net/net/pktnew.c:
	Direct NIC access no longer requires root all the time, only at

	It looks like this was the last thing that required root all the time.

	* src/: include/vc.h, env/video/Makefile, env/video/vc.c,
	  env/video/vga.c, env/video/vga.h, env/video/video.c:
	vga.c cleanups and changes:
	* made lots of functions static, moved out of vga.h
	* use constant PLANE_SIZE of 64K; always save 256K in standard VGA modes
	* moved the state save to the end of the video init (init_vga_card)
	  and don't let it clear the saved Linux video memory (from Stas)
	* improved diagnostics
	vc.c: repaired dosemu -c

	* src/plugin/kbd_unicode/serv_xlat.c:
	Dead keys should not cause the display of question marks.

	* src/plugin/term/: keyb_slang.c, terminal.c:
	Make DOSEMU compatible with SLang 2.0.

	  src/env/video/matrox.c, src/env/video/vga.c, src/include/pci.h,
	  src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	* cleaned up pci_bios.c<->pci.c interface (Stas)
	* pci_bios.c now registers i/o and memory areas for all PCI devices
	* the real PCI interface can no longer be iopl(3) optimized because
	  of the port server
	* don't allow byte access to port 0xcf9 (can reset the CPU)
	* implemented a read-only PCI emulation interface based on the values
	  found at init. This only applies to selected PCI devices (eg VGA)
	* use PCI emulation by default with console graphics if PCI is available,
	  unless $_pci=(on)
	* allow I/O to all ports that PCI reports about VGA (closes #687024)
	* changed DPMI fn 0x800 to report about mmap'ed PCI memory areas, so
	  that LFB's work in the console
	* removed now obsolete $_console_pci and $_console_ports

2004-10-08  Bart

	* src/env/video/console.c:
	If the Linux console uses fbcon we can force a complete text redraw
	by doing two (round-trip) vc switches; otherwise (vgacon) it doesn't hurt.

	* src/: env/video/vc.c, env/video/vga.c, include/vc.h:
	Only reprogram the graphics and sequencer registers like they are in
	VGA mode 12 when saving/restoring video memory. Skipping the CRT registers
	is sometimes a little easier on the eye, when fbdev causes
	dosemu_vga_screenoff() not to do its job.

2004-10-07  Bart

	* src/emu-i386/do_vm86.c:
	0x66 0xef should be "out dx,eax", NOT "out edx,eax".

2004-10-03  Stas

	* src/base/init/parser.y.in:
	Do not fallback to "direct" for unknown vnet mode, just abort the dosemu.
	Wrong configs should not be allowed.

	* src/dosext/net/net/pktnew.c:
	Do not fallback to dynamic TAP allocation if the requested static
	allocation fails.

	* src/base/misc/smalloc.c:
	smalloc: It turned out safer to fail on zero-sized mallocs, rather than
	to do nothing. Otherwise people expect realloc() to work on the pointers
	returned by malloc(0).

	* etc/dosemu.conf:
	Increased LFB size to 4Mb under X.

	* etc/dosemu.conf, src/base/init/parser.y.in,
	  src/dosext/net/net/libpacket.c:
	- Enabled Packet Driver by default.
	- Clarified the pkt-related options in dosemu.conf.
	- $_vnet="direct" added - same as $_vnet="".

2004-10-02  Stas

	* src/base/serial/ser_ports.c:

2004-09-30  Bart

	* src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c:
	Include lfn.h (compiler warning)

2004-09-29  Bart

	* src/dosext/misc/xms.c:
	Removed some unnecessary #includes and function.

	* src/: dosext/misc/xms.c, env/video/vesa.c, include/vesa.h:
	Split off VESA definitions into a global header file.
	Always use the "aggressive" way to find UMBs (this is really the clean
	way, the real difference for umb_max is in video.c).
	For this to work the VGAEMU BIOS has to be registered though (in vesa.c).

	* src/arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c:
	Allow kmem mmaps with non-fixed targets.

2004-09-27  Stas

	* src/: include/smalloc.h, base/misc/smalloc.c:
	Made smget_area_size() signed.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Install the realmode callback trampoline only when program allocates
	the callback. This fixes some extremely buggy program. (Bug #1033901)

	* src/: dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, dosext/dpmi/dpmi.h, emu-i386/do_vm86.c:
	More accurate realmode callback address calculations.

	* src/base/misc/smalloc.c:
	smalloc: smget_area_size() should return -1 on failure, since 0 can be valid
	(found by megath@users.sourceforge.net)

	* src/base/misc/smalloc.c:
	smalloc: realloc(NULL, size) should work as malloc(size), rather than to fail.
	Bug found by megath@users.sourceforge.net.
	I was sure there are no bugs in smalloc... but dosemu never uses that trick.

2004-09-26  Bart

	* src/base/mouse/mouseint.c:
	Don't (un)freeze the mouse if there is no mouse,  because if we do that
	we get a SIGSEGV.

	* src/env/video/console.c:
	Don't clear the Linux console screen for $_graphics=(1). This will happen
	later anyway.

	* src/env/video/svgalib.c:

2004-09-26  Stas

	  src/base/init/parser.y.in, src/emu-i386/ports.c,
	  src/include/port.h:
	- export trace_ports from global.conf to dosemu.conf
	- ports are now fast by default unless they are mentioned in $_trace_ports
	- using explicit "fast" or "slow" it is possible to force the ioperm
	  independently of any tracing set -- based on patch #1019824

2004-09-24  Bart

	* src/dosext/mfs/: lfn.c, lfn.h, mfs.c:
	LFN: only explicitly close findfirst handles for ax=71a1, not if no more
	files are found. For unknown filehandles, chain through to DOS to give
	DOSLFN a chance if that is loaded.
	A process termination hook closes all findfirst handles connected to
	the PSP that is terminated.

2004-09-23  Stas

	* src/dosext/dpmi/msdos.c:
	Fix 2 silly bugs in msdos_pre_exec() noticed by Japheth (Bug #1028236)

2004-09-22  Bart

	* src/arch/linux/async/signal.c:
	Remove the signal wrapper wrapper again -- it may not work with some old
	glibc's. So may be worse after all than simply bypassing the wrapper.
	Now detect if glibc installs a wrapper, and if it does, use the kernel
	sigaction instead to force the kernel to call our handlers directly.

	* src/dosext/mfs/lfn.c:
	LFN: don't return . and .. in findfirst/next for root directories.
	don't clobber the getcwd dest more than absolutely necessary.
	small cleanup of /. removal -- this is already done by truename now

	320x200 modes are defined in XF86Config.

	* src/: base/bios/bios.S, dosext/mfs/lfn.c, dosext/mfs/mfs.c:
	Fix two bugs in the LFN support as per #1020635:
	* do not remove embedded spaces before dots and leading spaces.
	* fix interface between int21/ax=716c and int21/ax=6c00 to only transform
	  a "create" into an "open" if a file was really created, not if it already
	  existed, and to set cx to "created" (2).

2004-09-15  Stas

	* src/base/misc/smalloc.c:
	Small improvements and optimizations to smalloc.

2004-09-14  Stas

	* src/plugin/commands/builtins.c:
	com_dosallocmem()/com_dosfreemem() are no longer necessary.
	Why lowmem_alloc()/lowmem_free() are still there is because the
	builtins used to have many memory leaks and other mem violations.
	So allocating a private 2K pool for them is safer than to allow
	them to allocate from the main 32K pool. At least for a time.

	* src/: base/bios/bios.S, base/init/init.c, base/misc/Makefile,
	  base/misc/lowmem.c, include/lowmem.h, include/memory.h,
	  plugin/commands/builtins.c:
	- Shuffled the bios.S a bit to get a 32Kb of low memory for free.
	- Added a management for it - lowmem.[ch]. This is needed for VESA
	support.
	- Since the VESA support is not there yet, the usual victim is builtins,
	which are moved to use that heap instead of the on-fly DOS allocation
	that may be not always safe.

	* src/: arch/linux/mapping/mapfile.c, base/misc/Makefile,
	  base/misc/pagemalloc.c, dosext/dpmi/memory.c,
	  include/pagemalloc.h:
	smalloc replaces pagemalloc. The advantages:
	- Allocations are not limited with the page-granularity.
	- Doesnt require garbage-collection and therefore probaly has fewer bugs.
	- Much simpler and smaller code (4K vs 12K).

	* src/: base/misc/Makefile, base/misc/smalloc.c,
	  base/misc/zalloc.c, env/video/matrox.c, env/video/vga.c,
	  include/smalloc.h, include/zalloc.h, plugin/commands/builtins.c:
	Introducing the new memory allocator - smalloc. It is intended to
	replace both zalloc and pagemalloc and being suitable for the VESA
	driver.
	- Replaced zalloc allocator by smalloc. smalloc is only 4K of code,
	compared to 12K of zalloc. The advantages over zalloc:
	-- Has realloc() (smrealloc)
	-- Has normal free(), which doesn't require to specify the length to free.
	-- Code is much smaller and almost as simple as of zalloc.

	* src/: dosext/mfs/mfs.c, emu-i386/do_vm86.c, include/emu.h,
	  plugin/commands/builtins.c, plugin/commands/builtins.h,
	  plugin/commands/commands.c, plugin/commands/dosdbg.c,
	  plugin/commands/lredir.c, plugin/commands/unix.c,
	  plugin/commands/xmode.c:
	Fix dozens of memory violations in builtins, mostly detected by the
	smalloc memory allocator. The fixes include (but not limited to the)
	following:
	- Cease the usage of the low mem considerably by calling the helpers
	directly.
	- Protect do_call_back() against re-entering. This was happening
	when eg. cmdline is interrupted by ^C, it was not able to recover.
	- Track all the allocations of load_and_run_DOS_program() to free it
	on termination (leaks).
	- On dos_read()/dos_write() set int0x23 to our return point, so that
	dosemu can recover even in case of ^C.
	- Fix com_strfree() to free the region of a proper size.
	- dos_helper_r is no longer necessary.
	- com_dosread() was not checking the size specified by caller -
	memory corruption.
	- memory corruption with builtin_name, no longer use DOS mem for it.
	- etc...

	* src/emu.c:
	Fix gcc warning.

	* src/include/shared.h:
	shared.h must die.

	* src/include/emu.h:
	Video memory size should not be of a short type.

2004-09-11  Bart

	* VERSION, configure, configure.ac, src/plugin/commands/generic.S:
	Make generic.S backwards compatible with older DOSEMUs so we can easily
	use DOSEMU 1.2 & 1.3 at the same time. Bump version code to 1.3.1.1
	so that generic.S can do a runtime check. Remove obsolete pthread
	comment in configure.ac (forces reconfigure).

2004-09-10  Bart

	* src/: emu-i386/do_vm86.c, arch/linux/async/signal.c:
	Force restoration of GS before signal handlers but only if
	the libc uses signal wrappers and GS != 0.
	Also restore flags/fs/gs after a vm86 call to work around a bug
	in 2.4 kernels.
	The implementation is hackish -- any beautification improvements
	are welcome, but it seems to work.

	* src/: include/emu.h, arch/linux/async/signal.c:

	closing/reopening mouse on console switch doesnt work: we need to call
	DOSEMUMouseSetup() (at least) after opening, but we dont.
	It is better to not close it at all, just halt reading it should be enough.

	* src/plugin/kbd_unicode/keyb_raw.c:
	set_shiftstate() in raw_keyboard_init() causes NULL deref.

	* src/env/video/: svgalib.c, svgalib.h, vga.h:
	There is no conflict anymore between <vga.h> and "vga.h" so svgalib.c

	* src/plugin/commands/: Makefile, builtins.c, builtins.h,
	  generic.S, lredir.c, config/plugin_config.h,
	  config/plugin_inte6.h:
	Builtins plugin work:
	- Recursive invocations (unix -r et al) were not handled properly:
	every new invocation allocated the new mem pool, making the previous
	pool unaccessable. Now only one pool is allocated. Refcounting added
	to know when the pool is safe to destroy.
	- The above is an incompatible change for generic.S. Introduced the
	builtins interface versioning. Now if dosemu detects the outdated
	version of builtins, it will not run them and will ask user to upgrade.
	- Removed the code that was intended to allow calling builtins with
	far call. This code was never used and was broken since generic.S
	started to release memory at startup.
	- Moved DOS version checking from builtins.c to lredir.c.

	* src/base/serial/ser_init.c:
	Unlink the stalled lockfiles for serial and some debug messages cleanup.

	* src/emu.c:
	Remove dummy ign_sigs sighandler for leavedos() - our main sighandler

	That helps.

	This makes GTA to work again.
	What a mess in fact...
	This cannot be done effectively via mapping system because of the problems
	with uncommitted memory.
	This cannot be done via zalloc because zalloc lacks realloc.
	This patch does:
	- Make pagemalloc to manage multiple pools, and move it to src/base/misc
	- Allocate a memory pool for the committed DPMI allocations and manage it
	with pagemalloc. Uncommitted allocations, even after being committed, are
	still handled separately. This probably cannot be generalized.

	Hi Bart,

	     My fiancee really loves playing her old DOS games
	on DOSEMU, so thanks for the hard work!

	     Running my Scrabble game in DOSEMU, I saw visual
	defects.  After many hours of debugging, I traced the
	problem to instremu.c.

	     My code does "shl al,cl", which should set AL to
	zero when CL is 8.  But DOSEMU treats the 8 as though
	it were a zero.  No x86 CPU behaves this way.

	     According to the MASM reference:

	"On the 80186-80386 processors, shift counts larger than
	31 are masked off, but on the 8088 and 8086, larger shift
	counts are performed despite the inefficiency involved."

	     I experimentated with the other shift and rotate
	commands, and then made a patch to imitate the behavior
	of 80186 and later CPUs.  RCL and RCR are especially
	interesting...

	* src/plugin/kbd_unicode/serv_8042.c:
	Allow booting with $_xms=(off).
	dosemu always maps HMA, regardless of the $_xms setting. This check does
	nothing but prevents dosemu from booting with $_xms=(off).
	Unfortunaltely Win98/DOS hates our XMS driver, so possibility to disable
	it, must work.

	* src/: arch/linux/debugger/mhpdbgc.c, base/data.c,
	base/dev/misc/lpt.c, base/misc/hma.c, base/misc/ioctl.c,
	dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, dosext/misc/xms.c, dosext/net/net/pktnew.c,

	include/hma.h, include/xms.h, plugin/kbd_unicode/serv_8042.c:
	- dosio.h must die, use hma.h instead
	- small cleanups in hma.c
	- use separate a20_local and a20_global in xms.c

	* src/arch/linux/async/debug.c:
	The more debug info the better.

2004-05-31  Bart

	* src/dosext/mfs/mfs.c:
	Avoid fixed sized buffer and strcpy/strcat in exists()

2004-05-30  Bart

	* src/env/video/X.c:
	Use vga.seq.addr_mode == 2 instead of the number of planes to check for
	chain4 modes of planes. This fixes the Windows logo... #962683

	* src/arch/linux/mapping/mapshm.c:
	For realloc_mapping_shm we can't expand shared anonymous memory using mremap
	so we must allocate a new region and memcpy to it. Fixes a problem with
	WP 5.1's use of EMS

	* src/base/bios/int10.c:
	The int10 BIOS now determines whether a mode is text or graphics from
	the byte at 40:49. Also reduce use of global co and li by peeking these
	values from 40:xx. Eventually co and li should be completely removed.

2004-05-29  Bart

	* src/base/init/parser.y.in:
	Change stop_mouse c_printf to be a little more legible.

2004-05-29  Stas

	* src/dosext/dpmi/msdos.c:
	- Rewrote old_dos_terminate() as per suggestions in bug #909015
	- Disable fix-NULL-deref code as per suggestion in RFE #937984

2004-05-29  Bart

	* src/env/video/: X.c, vgaemu.c:
	Removed line_compare==0 workaround, since the CRTC init now initializes it
	correctly from the CRTC registers. Have to check at a few places in X.c
	to compensate. This fixes some display problems with bananoid.

	* src/env/video/X.c:
	Fix another scan_len case: fixes problems with resizing zx_emul. Only the
	bars remain.

2004-05-28  Bart

	* src/env/video/X.c:
	Force a redraw for bitmap text modes upon resizing. This helps for plain
	text modes but not for funny text modes such as the one zx_emul uses.

	* src/emu-i386/ports.c:
	Replace kernel 2.6 test as agreed upon during the last IRC

2004-05-25  Bart

	* src/env/video/crtcemu.c:
	Fix occasional wrong display or even page fault after an int10 mode change.

2004-05-24  Stas

	* src/dosext/dpmi/memory.c:
	Two use-after-free bugs in uncommitted mem code :(

2004-05-22  Bart

	* src/env/video/X.c:
	Fix hang when non-bitmap fonts were used.

	* src/env/video/: X.c, vgaemu.c:
	Decouple scan_len from co. Sometimes we must use scan_len instead of co...
	Since zx_emul has co=40 but scan_len=48 this is necessary.
	Now zx_emul displays everything correctly except for some annoying vertical bars
	I couldn't get rid off.

	* src/env/video/: X.c, vgaemu.c:
	Correct vgaemu height calculations and relax limits on columns on lines
	(as long as the product*2 is within 64k)

	* src/env/video/: X.c, seqemu.c, vgaemu.c:
	Respect sequencer for determining 8- or 9- pixel wide characters.
	X_update_text_screen should respect a changed display and resize.

	* src/: base/bios/int10.c, env/video/vgaemu.c:
	Text modes in X now update from the aliased memory (high up in the Linux
	address space), instead of 0xa0000-0xc0000; will be necessary to use
	instremu for text modes. Corrected one related screen_adr assignment.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Use syscall() for modify_ldt. Not sure if this fixes the Fedora problem yet
	but it is consistent with the other syscalls anyway.

	* src/: base/serial/ser_ports.c, arch/linux/async/sigsegv.c,
	dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, dosext/dpmi/memory.c, include/Linux/serial.h:
	Avoid the direct inclusion of kernel headers that seem to creep in
	by using private copies.

	* src/base/init/parser.y.in:
	Reverted Stas' mouse change with respect to the parser. $_mouse_dev="" should
	not disable the mouse for X/terminal/gpm, only for console.

2004-05-20  Bart

	* src/: include/vgaemu.h, env/video/crtcemu.c, env/video/vgaemu.c:
	Implement CRTC readonly flag (thanks to the dosbox source code for the hint :-P)
	Fixes the myth bug --only 72 out of 200 lines were displayed (#930572)
	Stas please close if you can confirm.

2004-05-20  Stas

	* src/base/serial/ser_ports.c:
	Fix transmit IRQ triggering code of ser_ports.c. Closes bug #944346.

2004-05-19  Bart

	* INSTALL, src/emu-i386/ports.c:
	Added sanity check to see if catching port i/o works.

2004-05-18  Bart

	* src/dosext/net/net/ipxglt.c:
	ipx_interface really should get the same treatment as ipx_route...

2004-05-10  Stas

	* src/base/: mouse/mouseint.c, init/parser.y.in:
	Dont try internaldriver if $_mouse_dev=""

2004-05-09  Stas

	* src/: include/mapping.h, arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c,
	arch/linux/mapping/mapshm.c:
	Dont use mapshm if MREMAP_FIXED is not available (this was implicitly
	checked together with mremap(,0,...), but not any longer).

2004-05-08  Bart

	* configure, configure.ac:
	Respect CFLAGS as set by the user.

	* etc/global.conf:
	Repair $_cpu="emulated"

2004-05-08  Stas

	* src/arch/linux/async/debug.c:
	asprintf() is a GNU extension and needs _GNU_SOURCE before <stdio.h>

2004-05-08  Bart

	* etc/global.conf:
	Add missing endif.

	* configure.ac, default-configure, configure,
	src/base/bios/Makefile, src/env/video/Makefile:
	Don't use CFLAGS for the 16bit BIOS asm files. The -g in there confused
	binutils/gdb and that was the reason for the -gstabs+. Now we can just
	use the standard dwarf-2 debug info in dosemu.
	Also default-configure must check for gpm, not libgpm in compiletime-settings.

	* etc/global.conf:
	Remove warning that wasn't any more ...

	* etc/global.conf:
	Correct new problem with $_chipset

2004-05-07  Bart

	* src/arch/linux/async/: Makefile, debug.c, debug.h, signal.c,
	sigsegv.c:
	Added Stas' auto-gdb patch. I changed two small things: avoid buf[255]
	(potential buffer overflow), and also output what "ldd" says.
	getconf GNU_LIBC_VERSION must be quite recent (GLIBC 2.3+ I think) by
	the way, doesn't work here with 2.2.4
	getconf: Unrecognised variable `GNU_LIBC_VERSION'
	That doesn't hurt though.

	* etc/global.conf, src/base/init/parser.y.in:
	Limit use of strlen in global.conf; move com port processing into a loop.
	For some reason foreach doesn't always play nicely with if :(
	Don't define a serial port in the parser with an empty device ("virtual"
	still works though)
	Please check if this doesn't break your favourite configuration.

2004-05-07  Stas

	* src/base/serial/: ser_init.c, ser_irq.c, ser_ports.c:
	Next round of serial low-latency work: disable the internal timers.
	Now, with the async notifications, we can sync with the real thing instead.
	This gains 20sec improvement here at burning a flash in MC.

	* src/base/serial/ser_ports.c:
	Remove wrong IRQ triggering code from ser_ports.c. Part of bug #944346

2004-05-05  Bart

	* src/: include/video.h, base/init/parsglob.h,
	base/init/parser.y.in:
	Hopefully last bunch of gcc-3.4 adjustments. Compiles cleanly and works now.

	* configure, configure.ac:
	gcc 3.4 doesn't like -mcpu= anymore. Use -mtune= instead.

	* src/dosext/misc/emm.c:
	Avoid lvalue casts.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Avoid lvalue casts... What a mess, probably push/pop style macros would be
	cleaner...

	* src/: emu-i386/do_vm86.c, include/cpu.h:
	Avoid more deprecated casts. Not sure if prefix66 ^ prefix67 is the right
	thing for ecx... Have to look that up.

	* src/emu-i386/cpu.c:
	Fixed GCC 3.3.3 warning:
	cpu.c:154: warning: use of conditional expressions as lvalues is deprecated
	cpu.c:154: warning: use of cast expressions as lvalues is deprecated

	* src/emu-i386/cputime.c:
	Don't zero trigger1 after usleep.

2004-05-02  Bart

	* src/: base/async/int.c, base/bios/int16.c, emu-i386/cputime.c,
	include/timers.h:
	Consolidated all idling calls that use a trigger into one common function
	with a common trigger. All triggers now reset after each usleep(). Also
	the MFS resets the trigger. There may be more places where that is useful.

	* src/env/video/: X.c, remap.c:
	reconfig.mem should become 0 again after redrawing the text screen.
	fixed an x-offset bug in remap.c: now X.c can properly draw rectangles of
	texts, and not just screen-wide blocks.
	The combination of these two changes makes bitmap fonts much faster.

2004-05-01  Bart

	* src/arch/linux/mapping/mapshm.c:
	From Stas: use MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS instead of IPC.

2004-04-30  Bart

	* src/: arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, env/video/vc.c:
	Repair !have_mremap_fixed and related vc code.

2004-04-29  Bart

	* src/base/async/int.c:
	Correct int15/ax=e801.

2004-04-29  Stas

	* src/dosext/dpmi/memory.c:
	Fix return value check.

	* src/: arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, env/video/vc.c:
	- Make MAPPING_COPYBACK to work for MAPPING_KMEM and MAPPING_LOWMEM in all
	cases.
	- Map lowmem instead of unmapping KMEM - this makes the interfaces more
	consistent.

2004-04-26  Bart

	* src/dosext/net/net/ipxglt.c:
	From Michael Karcher: also check /proc/net/ipx/route for kernel 2.6

2004-04-25  Stas

	* src/: include/emu.h, plugin/kbd_unicode/prestroke.c:
	Fix memory corruption in keystroke handling + cleanups. Bug #909588.

2004-04-16  Stas

	* src/emu-i386/cpu.c:
	Fix some in_dpmi misuses. Noticed by japheth@users.sf.net, bug #934921.

2004-04-14  Stas

	* src/: arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, dosext/dpmi/memory.c:
	Fix mprotect size, cosmetic.

2004-04-12  Bart

	* src/plugin/term/keyb_slang.c:
	Get rid of the "inconsistency in define key" warning message where it's
	harmless.

	* src/env/video/: vc.c, vga.c:
	Fix a couple of small new bugs encountered in the cleaned up video code.

2004-04-11  Bart

	* src/: arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, env/video/vc.c,
	include/mapping.h:
	Mostly from Stas: use COPYBACK cap to avoid a temporary buffer when
	flipping between /dev/mem memory and low memory.
	Bart: clean up a bit, use size_t instead of off_t (off_t is a signed
	type used for file offsets!) and remove the root checks (if extended
	mremap is available).

	* src/: include/vc.h, env/video/console.c, env/video/vc.c,
	env/video/vga.c, env/video/video.c:
	Clean up vc get/put video ram routines. It should now be clear how and
	where to apply Stas' patch.

	* src/: emu.c, env/video/X.c, include/video.h,
	plugin/term/terminal.c, env/video/console.c, env/video/dualmon.c,
	env/video/hgc.c, env/video/video.c:
	Introduced a priv_init field for the video system. priv_init (for now) calls
	the old console driver init procedure. init calls the console driver
	post_init and for the terminal and X the normal init. Hopefully this doesn't
	break too much -- terminal and X still work.

2004-04-08  Bart

	* src/dosext/mfs/lfn.c:
	Implemented our own LFN filematch routine, with a little help from
	GLIBC. Special trick is to add a period if it's not there so that:
	dir *.
	matches all files without an extension.
	log and log? match log (==log.), but log?? doesn't match.

	* src/dosext/mfs/lfn.c:
	LFN: wildcard delete and findfirst/next need to match both sfn's and lfn's!
	-- in Win98 "dir *1.*" will give you almost all LFNs.
	Next stage will be to dumb down fnmatch with a custom version.

2004-04-07  Stas

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Sanity check triggers false-positives.

2004-04-06  Stas

	* src/include/emu.h:
	Restart syscalls after EINTR. Should fix #885692.

	* src/: dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, emu-i386/cpu.c, include/emu.h:
	Dont allow client stack to run above the dosemu stack. This is a loosy
	attempt to work around a ESP CPU bug. Seems to get the ancient MS linker
	to work. (bug #929123)

	* src/include/emu.h:
	linux-2.6 needs SA_NODEFER to allow the recursive signal handling. We need
	2 nesting levels of SIGSEGV sometimes. (part of bug #929123)

2004-04-02  Stas

	* src/dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c:
	Dont print debug info twice. Also avoids crash when trying to dump the
	content of an uncommitted page after a Page Fault.

	* src/: base/async/int.c, base/bios/bios.S, dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c,
	dosext/dpmi/msdos.c, dosext/dpmi/msdos.h, include/doshelpers.h,
	include/int.h, include/memory.h:
	- Added wrappers for DOS I/O (int21/ah=0x3f,0x40) to allow read/write >64K.
	- Added helpers to pass data between the high and low mem.
	- PM API Translator adjusted to use the new wrappers for I/O operations.
	- READ_DS_COPIED no longer needed, removed.
	This patch allows 32rtm to work. This is a noticeable step - 32rtm allows
	to run win32 console apps (PE).
	Many thanks to japheth@users.sourceforge.net for locating so many problems
	and providing a usefull hints.

2004-03-30  Bart

	* src/: dosext/mfs/lfn.c, dosext/mfs/mfs.c, dosext/mfs/util.c,
	include/dos2linux.h:
	LFN updates: ported FreeDOS' truename function to be able to handle
	int21/ax=7160 better, and to avoid escaping the drive letter "sandbox".
	"...." = "..\..\.." etc work too.
	Just like dir c:\foo\.. when foo does not exist (another DOS oddity).

2004-03-29  Bart

	* src/emu-i386/ports.c:
	Remove the munmap(low memory) in the portserver. It no longer
	makes sense.

2004-03-29  Stas

	* src/dosext/dpmi/memory.c:
	Always map the uncommitted mem to zeropage.

	* src/: arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, base/init/init.c:
	- kmem_map_mapping() was necessary only to supply the lowmem hack.
	Since there is nomore a hack, kmem_map_mapping() is unnecessary.
	- add missing alloc_mapping() call.

2004-03-29  Bart

	* src/: emu.c, arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, env/video/console.c,
	env/video/vc.c, env/video/vga.c, env/video/video.c, include/emu.h,
	include/video.h:
	Introduced video_post_init(): mmaps /dev/mem for video RAM and
	sets up VC switch functionality.  This allows for the complete
	removal of the mapping.c hacks.

	* src/: emu.c, arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, base/dev/misc/lpt.c,
	base/init/dev_list.c, base/init/init.c, base/mouse/mouse.c,
	base/mouse/mouseint.c, base/serial/ser_init.c, emu-i386/cputime.c,
	emu-i386/ports.c, env/video/X.c, env/video/console.c,
	env/video/vc.c, env/video/video.c, include/emu.h, include/mouse.h:
	Seperate low memory initialization from the rest of the init and fixed
	a few NULL pointer dereferences...
	Note: this allows us to remove some hacks but by keeping a temporary
	fd to /dev/mem open during init we will also be able to mmap video
	ram after dropping privs, so more can be removed in mapping.c...
	Dropping privs can then be done much earlier, and also is independent
	from memory mapping.
	* printer: set BIOS values in printer_mem_setup()
	* video: set BIOS values in video_mem_setup()
	* dev_list: add mouse_reset and serial_reset handlers which just like
	  the keyboard reset handler fill in the BIOS values.
	* call the reset handler just before booting, not immediately after
	  the init handler
	* move the mouse_reset_to_current_video_mode() during init to
	  mouse_post_boot() (current_video_mode may be strange for fbdev now,
	  was 0....)
	* mouse.c: fixed sptr null dereference
	* mouseint.c: fixed mice->dev NULL deref
	* cputime.c: Video may be NULL for first console switches at init while
	  console code is playing with ioctls
	* ports.c -- can derive BIOS_VIDEO_PORT value from dosemu config
	* X.c check for config.X_font being NULL
	* removed a few superfluous calls to clear_screen() and set_video_bios_size()
	* vc.c: can't read the BIOS during the first get_video_ram and console
	  switch --- this really needs to be cleaned up...

2004-03-28  Stas

	* src/arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c:
	MAPPING_LOWMEM implies MAPPING_ALIAS.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/memory.c:
	Account only the committed memory for $_dpmi. Also properly account
	committing/uncommitting pages.

2004-03-28  Bart

	* src/arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c:
	Apply mremap /dev/mem areas functionality.
	Move old skip code over to new memory structure.
	Add #ifdefs for "REQUIRED_KERNEL_VERSION"

2004-03-27  Bart

	* src/arch/linux/mapping/mapshm.c:
	From Stas: replace kernel 2.6.1 check by a cleaner one.

	* src/: arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, base/init/init.c,
	include/mapping.h:
	Move my hack from init.c to mapping.c, hoping to merge with Stas'
	technique in case mremap is not available.
	Only one file left to change now though...

	* src/: arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, env/video/dualmon.c,
	env/video/hgc.c, env/video/matrox.c, env/video/vc.c:
	Next chunk of Stas' changes -- this one doesn't really do anything
	except for limiting the size of the patch I want to have a closer
	look at.

	* src/arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c:
	The basic changes need this one too, or DOSEMU is completely broken ...
	(sorry, my fault, Bart)

	* etc/global.conf, src/arch/linux/mapping/mapfile.c,
	src/arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, src/arch/linux/mapping/mapshm.c,
	src/base/misc/hma.c, src/dosext/dpmi/memory.c,
	src/dosext/misc/emm.c, src/include/mapping.h,
	src/include/Linux/mman.h:
	The small part of Stas' mapping cleanups.
	Remove "console" from global.conf for $_graphics=(1) since it already
	implies "console" in the parser anyway.

2004-03-16  Bart

	* src/base/dev/misc/lpt.c:
	Fix memory leak.

2004-03-15  Bart

	* Makefile.conf.in, src/commands/Makefile,
	src/arch/linux/Makefile.main:
	Define LD at the right place. Remove unnecessary exports in
	Makefile.main

2004-03-13  Stas

	* src/dosext/dpmi/msdos.c:
	Fix bug in function 0x56 (rename file), from #909015
	Properly return the canonicalized filename to DPMI client
	(from bug #909015)

	* src/dosext/dpmi/: dpmi.c, memory.c:
	Escaped bits from previous commit (use RWX, not RW).

2004-03-12  Bart

	* configure:
	autoconf

2004-03-11  Bart

	* VERSION:
	Bump up VERSION in CVS already so people won't confuse it with 
	1.3.0 from the tarball.

2004-03-11  Stas

	* configure.ac:
	More escaped bits from the mapping redesign commit.

	* src/base/misc/: dosio.c, shared.c:
	Escaped bits from the mapping redesign commit.

2004-03-11  Bart

	* src/: arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, base/init/init.c,
	include/mapping.h:
	Had to create an even bigger hack because the aliased low memory now
	overwrites any /dev/mem areas -- this broke console graphics.
	So we have to be careful to see which areas were already mapped to
	/dev/mem (using a char array that check if a page is /dev/mem or not)
	Hopefully with this working base I can start cleaning things up.

2004-03-10  Bart

	* src/dosext/dpmi/memory.c:
	Need to include "emu.h" before other headers to get config.h including
	_GNU_SOURCE...
	See /usr/include/features.h
	#ifdef  _GNU_SOURCE
	# define __USE_GNU      1
	#endif
	_GNU_SOURCE is documented. __USE_GNU is internal to Glibc (AFAICS)

2004-03-10  Stas

	* src/: arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, arch/linux/mapping/mapshm.c,
	dosext/dpmi/memory.c, dosext/sound/sound.c,
	arch/linux/dosext/sound/midid/midid.c, base/dev/dma/dma.c:
	- Use RWX permissions for IPC SHM by default instead of RW,
	otherwise we end up with the non-executable first meg (but it
	didnt hurt since on x86 it is possible to execute regardless).
	- Update my e-mail address :)

2004-03-08  Stas

	* src/: emu-i386/do_vm86.c, include/emu.h,
	plugin/commands/builtins.c:
	Alowing interrupts during the callbacks proved to be reliable, making a
	default.

	* src/plugin/commands/comcom.h, src/plugin/commands/commands.c:
	Remove the remaining traces of comcom.

2004-03-07  Stas

	* src/dosext/dpmi/: dpmi.c, dpmi.h, msdos.c:
	Properly free segregs after freeing memory block (from bug #909015)

	* src/: emu.c, arch/linux/mapping/mapfile.c,
	arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, arch/linux/mapping/mapshm.c,
	emu-i386/ports.c, emu-i386/simx86/memory.c, include/mapping.h,
	include/vm86plus.h:
	Removed direct kernel interfaces where possible and replaced inline asm
	by syscall() otherwise -- the latter allows glibc to use sysenter and
	friends.
	The calls for syscall() are extended_mremap, dosemu_sigaction,
	vm86_old and vm86_plus. Note however that dosemu_sigaction is only
	called when sigaltstack is not supported.

	* src/: base/bios/bios.S, dosext/dpmi/dpmi.c, include/bios.h:
	- Implemented extended exception stack frame (DPMI 1.0, needed by rtm32)
	- Allow Visible Page Faults (DPMI 1.0, needed by bug #909015 and rtm32)

	* src/: arch/linux/mapping/mapping.c, dosext/misc/emm.c,
	include/mapping.h:
	Update EMM to new mapping flag.

	* src/: base/misc/disks.c, base/misc/utilities.c, include/disks.h,
	include/utilities.h, tools/periph/hdinfo.c:
	eliminate libless_llseek. For hdinfo we can use _FILE_OFFSET_BITS==64
	as it's standalone. For disks.c it's safer to explicitly use *64 calls.
	#ifdef __linux__ is a little optimistic but doesn't hurt :)

	include/emu.h, include/mapping.h, include/memory.h:
	Mapping system revamp.
	- Added support for lowmem region, it is now a part of SHM segment.
	- Moved DPMI memory away from SHM segment.
	- Updated HMA, DPMI and other subsystems to the new mapping features.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/: dpmi.c, dpmi.h, msdos.c:
	Next part of bug #902742:
	- remaining issues with is_dos_selector() fixed.
	- couple of 16/32bit registers confusion fixed.
	dos_read/dos_write case is not yet.

	* src/dosext/dpmi/: dpmi.c, dpmi.h, msdos.c:
	Allocate 6 realmode stacks for each DPMI client instead of 16 for 
	all clients. Blinker extender is now supported (closes SR #855611).
