NEWS file for DOSEMU2
====================

This file contains a list of user visible changes in DOSEMU. For the
raw developer changelog please use "git log".

Version dosemu2-2.0pre5
=============
* SDL video backend is now default, which means a GPU-accelerated rendering
* lredir command was deprecated, use lredir2 with the new syntax
* unix.com syntax was slightly changed
* new tool sound.com is added to change sound and MIDI parameters at run-time
* LPT2 is now pre-configured to print to PDF files
* Added preliminary support for old MS-DOSes (>=3.3) and some DR-DOSes
* many improvements to dosdebug
* use logarithmic volume scale for sound
* Preliminary KVM support - a very fast execution on 64bit machines.
  Should be manually enabled in config for now.
* Many regressions fixed
* Added valgrind support, which allowed to find many obscure bugs
* Work-arounds to support the newer fluidsynth for MIDI
* More versions of libao are supported for sound (each having its own bugs).
  This is good when SDL2 is unavailable.
* munt support for mt32 (you need to download Roland ROMs yourself)
* built-in backtracer is added for a better crash logs.
  Used if gdb is not installed.
* clang is now supported to compile dosemu2
