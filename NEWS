NEWS file for DOSEMU
====================

This file contains a list of user visible changes in DOSEMU. For the
raw developer changelog please refer to ChangeLog.

Version 1.3.3 (2005-12-22)
=============
* "dosemu" starts xdosemu by default in X. Use "dosemu -t" to force terminal
  mode.
* Everyone, including root, needs to use "dosemu -s" to be able to use direct
  hardware access. The -s switch automatically uses direct VGA graphics and
  raw keyboard mode on the Linux console.
* Added support for x86-64, by using CPU emulation for V86 mode, running DPMI
  code natively.
* You can reboot the DOSEMU virtual machine using Ctrl-Alt-Del
* Added $_time_mode="linux" option to force the DOS clock to sync with
  the Linux time.
* Freed up 4K of UMB space.
* The utility unix.com can now execute Linux commands within DOSEMU
  interactively.
* Run-time plugins are used to allow binary distribution without depending
  on all libraries.
* Implemented debug breakpoints for DPMI.
* The SDL plugin (-S option) was improved so that it is almost as capable
  as the X plugin, and provides a safer way to get console graphics, using
  fbdev.
* 16 bpp graphics programs now run in X with 24/32 bpp.
* Long File Names are enabled by default.
* Many fixes for the outstanding mouse and keyboard problems.
* Customized SVGA drivers of Windows 3.11 can now be used instead
  of the Trident drivers (refer to Section 9.2 of README.txt).
* The -dumb switch quietens DOSEMU until the command is executed if a command
  is given. So "dosemu -dumb dir" gives a directory listing and nothing else.
* The default C: drive has changed from ~/dosemu/freedos to ~/.dosemu/drive_c
  (similar to Wine).

Version 1.3.2 (2005-05-20)
=============
* Windows 3.1 now works natively, without any need for WINOS2 patches.
* Many other improvements to make Windows 3 in DOSEMU more stable and usable.
* Fixed IF flag virtualization for DPMI. This causes many DPMI applications
  to work reliably without random crashes (such as Transport Tycoon, Screamer,
  Vchess).
* Implemented LDT virtualization / direct LDT access for DPMI clients.
* Many DPMI and PM API translator fixes to support all commercial
  Borland tools and other protected-mode programs. You may need Linux
  kernel 2.6.12-rc3 or more recent versions however to get truely
  reliable DPMI support.
* Most of the DPMI 1.0 API and functionality were added.
* The redirected drive filesystem code is much faster than before.
* Fixed new errors and warnings with GCC 4.0.
* It is now possible to use an external XMS driver, such as himem.sys.
* Added the "INT 15h" PS/2 mouse interface.
* I/O ports are "fast" by default.
* Added some support for sound recording.
* The floppy is much faster with 2.6 kernels.
* Added support for 2.88M floppies
* The printer code now uses line buffering so that you do not have to
  wait $_printer_timeout seconds before printing starts.
* TTY locking can be disabled by $_ttylocks=""
* IPX and Packet Driver code was seriously reworked.
* The reliability and performance of the serial ports emulation are much
  improved.
* Terminal improvements:
  - UTF-8 terminals are supported if you use SLang 2 or a UTF-8
    patched SLang 1 library. The supplied SLang library subset is no
    longer necessary and no longer provided.
  - $_term_char_set no longer exists;
    $_external_char_set now defaults to the current locale.
  - Even on non UTF-8 terminals many line drawing characters can now
    be used, and on the Linux console almost the full CP437 character set.
  - Many ctrl, alt, shift combinations with function keys, arrow keys, etc,
    can now be used in xterm and friends.
  - VGA hardware is emulated in terminal mode as well as in X mode.
* Console improvements:
  - VESA driver added which should be compatible with most BIOSes. This
    is the default.
  - Linear frame buffers now work.
  - Improved behaviour in conjunction with framebuffer consoles.
* X improvements:
  - Added extra X fonts (thanks to Martin Reuber)
  - The X aspect ratio is no longer set to 4:3 by default, but an integer
    multiple of the real resolution.
  - Much improved keyboard layout autodetection
  - Fixed a grave bug which caused the keyboard not to work properly in
    some games.
  - A graphical mouse cursor now works under X with mouse grab enabled.
  - Added keyboard grab, hardcoded to Ctrl-Alt-k for now.
* Added experimental SDL plugin. Mostly functional; makes it possible to run
  DOSEMU on all supported SDL backends.

Version 1.3.1 (2004-07-11)
=============
* Support for 32rtm extender was added. It is now possible to use the
  32bit Borland tools under dosemu.
* Support for the HX DOS Extender was added. It is now possible to run
  some win32 console apps under dosemu, using that extender.
* The Blinker extender is now fully supported (all known versions).
  But some older versions of that extender may require the 2.4.x linux
  kernel (linux-2.6.8 will include the necessary fix).
* Improved DPMI uncommitted memory support (started in 1.3.0).
* The hogtheshold code was reorganized to be able to pass through certain
  events quicker (such as loading a file in FreeDOS EDIT) even when you 
  have it set to "1".
* Fixed all new warnings with GCC 3.4.
* Fixed compilation problem with Fedora Core 2 headers.
* Added cp895 and bg-mik character set support.
* Many VGAEMU bugs were fixed, and bitmap fonts are much quicker.
* Allow "fast" i/o ports above 0x400 for kernels that support it
  (2.6.7-mm kernels only for now)
* Implemented VxD hooks for WinOS2: seems to solve all remaining problems with
  Win3.1(WinOS2): allows Alt-Tab and the timer.
* Many DPMI and DOS extender fixes.
* An automatic backtrace using GDB (output in ~/.dosemu/boot.log)
  is attempted when DOSEMU crashes.
* Serial code fixes.
* Corrected int15/ax=e801 for so $_xms > 64M is reported correctly by MEM.
* Fix NPTL issues when switching VC's on the console.
* Check /proc/net/ipx/route etc for kernel 2.6.x.
* LFN (long file name) fixes. Still needs more testing
* Fixed read/write problem for files with negative file offsets on
  lredir'ed drives.
