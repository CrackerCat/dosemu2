TODO items for the next release:

- revisit COPYING.DOSEMU and solve its problems

- merge "devel" branch

- decide what to do with slirp and the respective branch
    DONE: added vde support.
    However, since it needs patches and is not packaged by fedora,
    there may still be the place for an embedded slirp (not what current
    slirp branch provides)

- look into all the cpuemu-related bugreports
    DONE, everything is revisited and fixed

- bring the new sound code to the state where it can replace
  the old sound code
